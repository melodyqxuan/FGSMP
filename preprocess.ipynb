Since then, it has seen the fastest subscription growth of any Prime market, with members now in 95% of municipalities, Amazon said in a statement.\\n\\nYet, Prime alone may not be enough to boost Amazon’s fortunes, said Gene Munster, managing partner of Loup Ventures, pointing out inventory and distribution as two key areas where Amazon needs to improve.\\n\\n“Undoubtedly it’s growing,” he said of the Prime program. “But it’s not a question about growing, it’s about trying to keep pace with MercadoLibre.”\\n\\nThat can be a challenge despite the fact that the local champion lacks a membership perks program on par with Prime. Adding to MercadoLibre’s headstart since its 1999 founding, the company has a broad base of sellers and understands the local terrain.\\n\\nLyana Kahn, founder of Mexican jewelry company LuckyLy, said her sales on Amazon have benefited from Prime’s shipping and discount perks for customers.\\n\\n“It’s a great platform that gives you the push to reach more customers without a huge investment,” Kahn said. Even so, LuckyLy also sells its sparkly earrings and gold-plated necklaces on several other sites, including MercadoLibre.\\n\\n“Every platform has something different to offer,” Kahn said. “There’s space for everything.”\\n\\n($1 = 21.2110 Mexican pesos; 5.5316 reais)',\n",

The delay weighed on the company’s shares, even after its beat-and-raise earnings report.\\n\\nLate in the session, rival Eli Lilly & Co said it was also halting its coronavirus antibody trial because of safety concerns.\\n\\n“We have this recent spike in coronavirus cases coinciding with big drug companies halting vaccine trials,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. “That’s making the market nervous and in response, you’re seeing the lockdown stocks moving higher.”\\n\\nHopes for the passage of a new coronavirus relief package faded as U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi rejected the $1.8 trillion coronavirus relief proposal from the White House, saying it “falls significantly short of what this pandemic and deep recession demand.”\\n\\nSenate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Republican-led Senate would vote on a targeted pared-down stimulus package on Monday.\\n\\nMeanwhile, millions of Americans struggle to make ends meet nearly two-and-a-half months after emergency unemployment assistance expired.\\n\\n“(Washington is) playing with the market’s emotions and individuals’ financial futures,” SlateStone Wealth’s Pavlik added. “As this continues, the market is looking past what they’re saying because it truly believes stimulus will come some time after the election.”\\n\\nJPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc were the first two major U.S. banks to report third-quarter results.\\n\\nAlthough JPMorgan handily beat consensus profit estimates, gaining from a boom in its trading business, its peer Citigroup, while also beating expectations, was slammed by low interest rates and a slowdown in loan demand. Their shares, along with the broader S&P Banking index lost ground.\\n\\nApple Inc shares slid after unveiling the latest incarnation of its flagship gadget, the iPhone 12 with 5G connectivity.\\n\\nUnofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 158.04 points, or 0.55%, to 28,679.48, the S&P 500 lost 22.51 points, or 0.64%, to 3,511.71 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 12.36 points, or 0.1%, to 11,863.90.\\n\\nThird-quarter reporting season has left the starting gate, and analysts now see S&P 500 earnings, in aggregate, falling by 19.6% year-on-year, according to Refinitiv.\\n\\nOther earnings on tap this week include Bank of America Corp , Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Wells Fargo & Co , UnitedHealth Group and United Airlines Holdings Inc expected on Wednesday, with Morgan Stanley and Honeywell International Inc due on Thursday.\\n\\nShares of Delta Air Lines Inc dropped after the commercial carrier reported a 76% plunge in quarterly revenue and announced it has delayed a targeted halt to its cash bleed.\\n\\nPlanemaker Boeing Co reported order cancellations for its grounded 737 MAX aircraft and said deliveries were less than half the number as the same month a year ago. The stock was the heaviest drag on the Dow. (Reporting by Stephen Culp Editing by Marguerita Choy)',\n",

       " {'news': \"FILE PHOTO: Signage is seen at an Amazon facility in Bethpage on Long Island in New York, U.S., March 17, 2020. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly\\n\\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four Democratic U.S. senators on Thursday sent a letter to Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, demanding answers over its alleged moves to track and monitor employees and limit efforts to form unions.\\n\\nDemocratic senators Brian Schatz, Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Kirsten Gillibrand asked the company for details on the steps it takes to discourage workers from organizing, how it tracks workers who participate in strikes and the law firms Amazon contracts with for union avoidance.\\n\\n“The fact that Amazon has decided to heavily invest in systems to retaliate against freedom of expression about unsafe and unhealthy working conditions, and to refer to organizing and workers’ rights mobilization efforts as threats against the company equal to those posed by hate groups and terrorism, is unacceptable,” the letter led by senator Brian Schatz said.\\n\\nIn September, a research paper from the Open Markets Institute, a Washington-based research and advocacy group, also said Amazon relies on extensive worker surveillance to boost employee output and potentially limit unionization efforts around the United States. reut.rs/31bhOP2\\n\\nThe letter from the lawmakers on Thursday referred to several media articles that have reported similar action by the retailer.\\n\\nThis month, Amazon said more than 19,000 of its U.S. front-line workers contracted the novel coronavirus this year, or 1.44% of the total, a disclosure sought by labor advocates who have criticized Amazon’s response to the pandemic.\\n\\nAn Amazon spokeswoman said the company respects its employees right to join or form a labor union without fear of retaliation, intimidation or harassment.\\n\\nOn the issue of monitoring, the spokeswoman said Amazon discovered one group within its delivery team that was aggregating information but the practice is against company standards and the team is no longer doing so.\\n\\nReuters reported in May that Amazon has long resisted unionization. Amazon spokeswoman Rachael Lighty said at the time that Amazon already offers what labor groups are requesting.\",\n",

       " {'news': '(Reuters) - Walmart Inc is aggressively expanding its advertising business after years of stuttering progress, even as a proposed deal to buy a stake in video-sharing app TikTok remains stuck in limbo.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: A shopper is seen wearing a mask while shopping at a Walmart store in Bradford, Pennsylvania, U.S. July 20, 2020. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid\\n\\nThe world’s largest retailer is making better use of its wealth of shopper data to link promotions on its website and app with ads inside its network of 4,700 U.S. stores, according to Reuters interviews with six advertising agencies and Walmart ad tech partners, three major brands plus bankers and ex-employees.\\n\\nThe refocused strategy was born early last year when Walmart cut ties with its external advertising partner and took the business in-house, calling it Walmart Media Group.\\n\\nThe company bet it could do a better job of bridging online and offline data for its advertisers and give itself a shot at developing an ad platform that could take on Amazon.com Inc, the sources said.\\n\\nThe shift has been paying off, according to one source briefed on the company’s plans who said Walmart Media Group was on track to earn nearly $1 billion of advertising sales this year, more than double the amount it brought in last year.\\n\\nWalmart declined to comment on the sales estimate, but it explained its approach to the ad business. “One thing we do at Walmart Media Group is make sure that the advertising we’re placing is additive to the customer experience, that we’re not just throwing ads on anything anywhere, that we’re really strategic,” Walmart spokeswoman Molly Blakeman said.\\n\\nThe big challenge now, according to the source, is figuring out how it can continue to expand the ad business into one that will matter to investors for a company that earned about $524 billion in total revenue in fiscal year 2020.\\n\\n“It’s going well, and they want it to go very, very well,” the source said. “There have been very material gains but it doesn’t yet put a dent in Amazon’s lead or Walmart’s top or bottom line.”\\n\\nA deal for TikTok, which reaches 100 million U.S. users a month, was supposed to supercharge the strategy by helping Walmart’s ad machine engage with younger audiences that may not shop regularly at Walmart. But the talks to invest in the Chinese-owned TikTok remain shrouded in political uncertainty.\\n\\nThat, however, has not stopped Walmart from moving ahead with its strategy, the advertising agencies and brands said.\\n\\nYet it’s early days in the drive for Walmart, which has historically struggled to create new lines of business and has never turned a profit form its e-commerce business. Some advertisers and ad agencies said the retailer still had a distance to go on the technology front, including tracking how ads translated into sales - a key selling point for brands.\\n\\nWalmart faces a huge task chasing Amazon, which is expected to generate about $13 billion in ads this year according to eMarketer, while it is also battling smaller rivals including Target and Kroger which are building their own ad platforms.\\n\\nAnother challenge it must overcome: Walmart disclosed this month that Stefanie Jay, leader of Walmart Media Group, will leave the company for a “new opportunity.” Rich Lehrfeld, Walmart’s former interim chief marketing officer, will now lead Walmart Media Group.\\n\\n‘ALWAYS IN, ALWAYS ON’\\n\\nIn meetings with brands and advertising technology partners, Walmart’s executives have summed up its goals with a tagline - “Always In, Always On” - a reference to how its store network will help advertisers reach more customers, Walmart told Reuters.\\n\\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\\n\\n“Whether it’s online or in the shopping aisle on a screen in the grocery section, they want that brand message through the whole ecosystem,” said Nich Weinheimer, general manager of e-commerce at ad tech firm Kenshoo, which works with Walmart.\\n\\nWalmart has used its data to improve targeting of ads and convinced some advertisers to sign long-term advertising contracts, brands and former employees say. The company told Reuters that its deals, which include store and digital ads, are typically worth low double-digit millions of dollars.\\n\\nDan Cooke, head of e-commerce at jam-maker JM Smucker Co which places ads with Walmart, told Reuters that the retailer had gathered better data on consumers and their purchases this year.\\n\\nWalmart has uses the data to improve its online display advertising, give clients a better idea of how their ads are performing and provide “critical” online tools that makes it easier for them to monitor and control campaigns themselves, he added.\\n\\n“There’s a bit of an arms race that’s going on - Amazon has certainly been a trailblazer,” said Cooke, adding that Walmart was responding “very aggressively.”\\n\\nKNOWING WHAT SELLS\\n\\nWalmart executives view the advertising drive as significant to the success of the retailer’s e-commerce business as a whole, according to the source briefed on the company’s plans.\\n\\nNearly 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of a Walmart, according to the retailer’s website. This is a strength that Walmart needs to leverage more, according to the ad agencies and brands, as it has an insight into consumers’ shopping habits.\\n\\nWalmart’s stores and Walmart.com together count about 160 million visitors a week, data from investment bank Cowen shows.\\n\\nWalmart’s advertising strategy has nonetheless been somewhat hit or miss over the decades.\\n\\nThe retailer, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, dabbled with the advertising business in the late 1990s and early 2000s with an in-store TV network that aired commercials. It expanded the business about 15 years ago to include its website through Triad Retail Media.\\n\\nThe retailer cut ties with Triad in February 2019 and brought all ad operations in-house under Walmart Media Group.\\n\\n‘GLITCHES’ COMPLAINTS\\n\\nThe company still faces a series of challenges.\\n\\nIt needs to improve ad-measuring capabilities to show exactly how certain ads lead to specific sales, Smucker’s Cooke said.\\n\\nSome advertisers have also complained about “glitches” where ads occasionally disappear from Walmart.com or don’t show up at all. Kimberly Williams, a former campaign manager at Walmart Media Group, said this happened “all the time”, recalling an ad for Mars Inc’s M&M candies that disappeared for several hours.\\n\\nAccording to brands, this happens from time to time on other retailers’ platforms as well. Walmart declined to comment.\\n\\nLonger term, the challenge for Walmart is to figure out an overarching media content strategy to keep customers engaged for longer periods, according to the industry players interviewed.\\n\\nWalmart considered launching a subscription video service in 2018 but decided against it, according to sources. In other forays, it invested $250 million in a joint venture to develop interactive content and struck a deal with “James Bond” studio Metro Goldwyn Mayer to create content for the Vudu video-on-demand service, which it sold last April.\\n\\nWalmart is also going after a new channel of ad revenue called “brand advertising,” typically reserved for TV, by offering more formats like online display ads, said George Manas, chief media officer at ad agency OMD USA.\\n\\nExecutives hope successful advertising relationships could help it secure promotional tie-ins with the Walmart+ subscription service, its version of Amazon Prime.\\n\\nLosing the TikTok deal won’t be a disaster, but landing it would help Walmart flesh out a competitive media strategy, said Mark Boidman, managing director and head of media and tech services at PJ Solomon, which advises Walmart.\\n\\n“Amazon surrounds the consumer in a 360-degree manner,” Boidman said, referring to Amazon Prime and the free video-streaming service that comes with it.\\n\\nWalmart is still “getting there.”\\n\\n(This story adds dropped word “former” in paragraph 13)',\n",

REUTERS/Abhishek N. Chinnappa/File Photo\\n\\nAmazon on Sunday won an injunction from a Singapore arbitrator to halt FRL’s deal to sell assets to Reliance. Amazon alleged FRL had breached certain contract provisions it entered into last year in a separate deal with the U.S. firm.\\n\\nThe dispute centres around FRL’s decision in August to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and some other businesses to Reliance for $3.38 billion, including debt.\\n\\nAmazon argues that a 2019 deal it had with a Future unit had clauses saying the Indian group couldn’t sell its retail assets to anyone on a “restricted persons” list including any firms from Reliance chief Mukesh Ambani’s group. The deal specified any disputes would be arbitrated under Singapore International Arbitration Centre rules.\\n\\nShares in Reliance and FRL fell on Monday. Both companies reacted to the arbitrator’s decision by saying they want to complete the deal “without any delay”, setting the stage for a showdown between Reliance and Amazon - each led by one of the world’s richest men.\\n\\nA 130-page order by the arbitrator reveals how Jeff Bezos-led Amazon argued that Future breached agreements which barred it from selling retail assets to entities including Reliance, whose boss Ambani is Asia’s richest man. It also shows the level of concern at Future if the deal breaks.\\n\\nFuture’s retail unit - which has more than 1,500 outlets - will need to pack up if the transaction with Reliance doesn’t go through, hitting the livelihoods of thousands of employees and workers at its vendor firms, the Indian group argued before the arbitrator, according to the order which is not public.\\n\\nLEGAL OBLIGATIONS\\n\\n“If the disputed transaction falls through, FRL will go into liquidation. That will mean that the livelihoods of more than 29,000 employees of FRL will be lost,” the Indian group’s representatives told the arbitrator V.K. Rajah, a former attorney general of Singapore.\\n\\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has hit many Indian businesses, especially in the retail sector, and the FRL-Reliance deal was aimed at protecting the interests of all stakeholders through a large infusion of funds and the acquisition of liabilities, Future argued at the tribunal.\\n\\nBut Rajah ruled that “economic hardship alone is not a legal ground for disregarding legal obligations”.\\n\\nAmazon, FRL and Reliance didn’t respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nAmazon welcomed the arbitrator’s decision in a previous statement. FRL has said it would take appropriate steps to ensure its deal proceeds unhindered, while Reliance said it will complete the transaction.\\n\\nAmazon, which counts India as a key growth market where it has invested $6.5 billion, has already been bogged down by antitrust probes and strict foreign investment rules.\\n\\nThe latest tussle puts Amazon at odds not just with FRL but also Ambani and his Reliance group which is fast expanding its e-commerce business, and threatening the dominance of Amazon and Walmart’s Flipkart in that space.\\n\\nTwo sources familiar with the matter said the injunction was not automatically enforceable in India and that the order would have to be ratified by an Indian court.\\n\\nAny subsequent legal order in India to halt the deal would allow Amazon to negotiate with Reliance, Future and banks on the other side, said Murali Neelakantan, a corporate lawyer at Indian law firm Amicus which is not involved in the case.\\n\\n“If Amazon doesn’t get an injunction against the deal proceeding in India, they will probably just get damages even if they win the final arbitration,” Neelakantan said.',\n",

The company typically addresses such questions during an analyst call after its financial report.\\n\\n“Do they have the logistics and delivery capacity to handle order volumes?” Sebastian asked.\\n\\nMichael Pachter, of Wedbush Securities, cited anecdotes about recent warehousing constraints for certain larger items. “I think you’re going to have a disastrous fourth quarter in terms of demand overwhelming them once again,” he said.\\n\\nAmazon has long worked to avoid a repeat of the 2013 season when delays left some without gifts on Christmas Day. The company now handles more deliveries in house, and this year it moved its marketing event Prime Day - usually in July - to October, letting shoppers place holiday orders early.\\n\\nPachter said, “They wanted us to start thinking ‘holiday’ now, before the crazy rush that begins Black Friday.”\\n\\nThe extra weeks of shopping may translate into additional sales, with higher-income households offsetting those with depressed budgets for holiday spending.\\n\\nAnalysts on average expect revenue of $92.7 billion for the just-ended third quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\",\n",

       " {'news': '(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O on Thursday forecast a jump in holiday sales - and costs related to COVID-19 - as consumers continued to shop more online during the pandemic.\\n\\nA company executive added that heightened spending on delivery infrastructure would likely continue over years, and shares fell 2% in after-hours trading.\\n\\nSince the start of the virus outbreak in the United States eight months ago, consumers have turned increasingly to Amazon for delivery of groceries, home goods and medical supplies. Brick-and-mortar shops closed their doors; Amazon by contrast moved to recruit over 400,000 workers and earned $6.3 billion in the just-ended quarter, its second consecutive record profit.\\n\\nThat has kept the world’s largest online retailer at the center of workplace and political tumult. Democratic politicians this month accused Amazon of holding “monopoly power” over merchants on its platform, which the company disputes. Meanwhile, more than 19,000 of Amazon’s U.S. employees contracted COVID-19, and some staff protested for site closures.\\n\\nAmazon’s response now includes an estimated $4 billion in costs related to COVID-19 this holiday, up from $2.5 billion last quarter. It is testing employees for the virus and getting protective gear for new hires. It also is working less productively because of social distancing at its warehouses, which accounts for a big part of its pandemic expense, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with reporters.\\n\\nAmazon forecast operating profit to be between $1.0 billion and $4.5 billion, short of $5.8 billion analysts were looking for, according to research firm FactSet.\\n\\nCompetition this holiday remains fierce for the company in retail - and in the cloud. A traditional bright spot, cloud computing division Amazon Web Services (AWS) is dueling with smaller rival Microsoft Corp MSFT.O for business with a big potential during the pandemic, from remote work to cloud-based gaming.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: The Amazon logo is seen at the Amazon fulfilment center in Bretigny-sur-Orge near Paris, France, October 22, 2019. REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol\\n\\nIn the just-ended third quarter, AWS sales grew 29%, while Microsoft reported a 48% rise in revenue for its Azure cloud.\\n\\n‘TIGHT ON CAPACITY’\\n\\nStill, Amazon’s sales are shaping up to hit a record level. Jeff Bezos, Amazon’s chief executive and richest person in the world, said in a press release, “We’re seeing more customers than ever shopping early for their holiday gifts, which is just one of the signs that this is going to be an unprecedented holiday season.”\\n\\nThe company reported that customers in its loyalty club Prime were shopping more often, renewing their membership at higher rates and, internationally, turning to Amazon much more for video entertainment. Merchants also expanded their budgets for advertising on Amazon in the third quarter versus a contraction during the pandemic’s spring peak.\\n\\nThe question for some analysts has been whether Amazon’s consumer division can keep up with still-growing purchases during the pandemic.\\n\\nThe company has long worked to avoid a repeat of the 2013 season when delays left some without presents on Christmas Day. Amazon now handles more deliveries in house, and this year it moved its marketing event Prime Day - usually in July - to October, letting customers place holiday orders early.\\n\\nCFO Olsavsky told reporters that the company is “not totally insulated” from challenges its delivery partners may be facing this quarter, though the online retailer feels ready for the holiday season.\\n\\n“We do think it will be tight on capacity industry-wide, and we’re no exception to that,” he said. “It does behoove shoppers to shop early.”\\n\\nOlsavsky said on a call with analysts that Amazon’s fulfillment and logistics square footage would be 50% higher this year. He said the company already has spent heavily on expanding its transport capability, part of some $30 billion in capital expenditures and leases through the third quarter. The heightened transportation investment will likely continue over years to come, he said.\\n\\nFor the fourth quarter, Amazon said it expects net sales of $112 billion to $121 billion. That would mark the company’s first over $100 billion and follows a third-quarter revenue beat that analysts such as eMarketer’s Andrew Lipsman did not expect.\\n\\n“While it was clear that the pandemic-driven shift to e-commerce would keep Amazon’s topline elevated, it surprised by easily surpassing an already high bar,” Lipsman said.',\n",

       " {'news': 'BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union charged Amazon AMZN.O with damaging retail competition, alleging on Tuesday that the U.S. company uses its size, power and data to gain an unfair advantage over smaller merchants that sell on its online platform.\\n\\nThe move by competition chief Margrethe Vestager, the latest European salvo against U.S. tech giants, comes at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified Amazon’s role in the global economy, with online sales soaring in lockdowns.\\n\\nThe European Commission has been investigating Amazon’s position as both a marketplace for merchants and a rival seller, while the firm also faces scrutiny in the United States over its alleged mistreatment of sellers, as well as its dual role.\\n\\nThe EU regulator looked into how Amazon collects data on competitors that sell on its platform, offering everything from electronics and toys to food and kitchenware. It says that Amazon uses that sensitive information, which shows what is proving popular or not, to better target its own products.\\n\\n“The use of these data allows Amazon to focus on the sale of the best-selling products and it marginalises third-party sellers and caps their ability to grow,” European Competition Commissioner Vestager told a news conference.\\n\\nVestager, who has a reputation of being one of the world’s toughest antitrust enforcers, said that regulators had to ensure that dual-role platforms with market power, such as Amazon, did not distort competition.\\n\\nAmazon disagreed with the EU assertions.\\n\\n“Amazon represents less than 1% of the global retail market, and there are larger retailers in every country in which we operate,” the company said.\\n\\nA U.S. Congressional antitrust report earlier this year into the alleged abuse of market power by Amazon also raised the concerns highlighted by the EU and is likely to influence the case U.S. regulators bring against the company.\\n\\nU.S. Representative David Cicilline, a Democrat and the top antitrust lawmaker in the House, applauded the EU and urged the U.S. Federal Trade Commision to take similar action.\\n\\n“As we found as part of a 16-month bipartisan investigation, Amazon has monopoly power over sellers on its platform,” Cicilline said.\\n\\nThe EU charges are the latest example of how watchdogs around the world, led by Europe, are grappling with the challenges of regulating Big Tech, companies that have achieved dominance in their fields and vast troves of user data.\\n\\nOn Vestager’s watch, the EU has imposed large fines on Alphabet’s Google and other companies. See FACTBOX:\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: Amazon boxes are seen stacked for delivery in the Manhattan borough of New York City, January 29, 2016. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo\\n\\nA final EU decision could come next year. Amazon faces being fined up to 10% of its global turnover if found guilty of breaching antitrust rules. However it can avoid a hefty penalty and a finding of wrongdoing by offering concessions to settle.\\n\\nNEW INVESTIGATION\\n\\nThe EU competition enforcer has been investigating Amazon since July last year after rival traders voiced their grievances. The regulator said the charges related to Amazon’s activities in France and Germany, its two biggest markets in Europe and where it is the dominant player.\\n\\nThe case focuses on its use of merchant data on its platform. Vestager said her officials had trawled 80 million transactions and reviewed 100 million products on Amazon’s platform to put the case together.\\n\\nThe European Commission also opened a new investigation into Amazon on Tuesday, over the possible preferential treatment of its own retail offers and those of marketplace sellers that use Amazon’s logistics and delivery services.\\n\\nThat probe will look into the possible preferential treatment of Amazon’s own retail offers and those of marketplace sellers that use Amazon’s logistics and delivery services.\\n\\nRegulators will investigate the criteria the company uses to select winners of its “buy box”, which allows customers to add items from a specific retailer directly into their shopping carts.\\n\\n“Its rules should not artificially favour Amazon’s own retail offers or advantage the offers of retailers using Amazon’s logistics and delivery services,” Vestager said, citing the importance of e-commerce, an area which has gained importance with the COVID-19 pandemic.',\n",

       " {'news': '(Corrects to remove reference to Taylor Swift in paragraph 6)\\n\\nHANGZHOU, China, Nov 11 (Reuters) - China’s Alibaba said orders made through its e-commerce sites during its Singles’ Day shopping extravaganza had exceeded $56 billion by Wednesday morning, as lockdown-weary consumers splashed out on as many as 16 million discounted products.\\n\\nThe world’s biggest sales event - eclipsing Black Friday and Cyber Monday in the United States combined - stretches over four main days this year, and so far has brought sellers on Alibaba platforms 16 times as many orders by value than Amazon.com Inc clocked last month in its two-day global Prime Day.\\n\\nThe performance will likely come as a relief to Alibaba Group Holding Ltd a week since it lost about 10% of its market value after regulators pulled the listing of financial technology affiliate Ant Group.\\n\\nThe sale also comes amid an economic rebound with the spread of the novel coronavirus in China under control, while border closures abroad have meant more consumers spending at home. Such is its size that its performance is widely considered indicative of the strength of China’s post-virus recovery.\\n\\nAlibaba, which launched the shopping event in 2009, began the sale early this year to give lesser-known brands more exposure. It scheduled primary discount days for Nov. 1 through Nov. 3 as well as the usual Nov. 11, and will calculate gross merchandise volume (GMV) over the 11 days, rather than 24 hours.\\n\\nThe event is usually a splashy affair accompanied by live performances, with Katy Perry appearing this year at Alibaba’s gala late on Tuesday, albeit via livestream.\\n\\nAs well as simple percentage discounts from regular prices, Alibaba encourages shoppers across its numerous platforms to play mobile games, combine purchases across shops and place orders in the sale’s first few hours to get the best deals.\\n\\nAs of 12:30 a.m. local time (1630 GMT) on Nov. 11, GMV had surpassed 372.3 billion yuan ($56.3 billion) with orders peaking at a record 583,000 per second, Alibaba said. Over 2 million products featured in the sale for the first time - double last year, when GMV for Nov. 11 reached a record $38.4 billion.\\n\\nOver 340 firms, including Apple Inc, L’Oreal SA , Huawei Technologies Co Ltd and Nike Inc , have exceeded 100 million yuan in sales, and 13 brands have recorded GMV above 1 billion yuan, Alibaba said.\\n\\nRivals JD.com Inc and Pinduoduo Inc as well as firms such as Douyin - the Chinese version of Beijing ByteDance Technology Co Ltd’s TikTok - are also holding events for Singles’ Day, which falls on the 11th day of the 11th month.\\n\\nJD.com, which started Singles’ Day promotions on Nov. 1, said it recorded 200 billion yuan worth of sales within nine minutes of midnight on Wednesday, while electronics retailer Suning.com Co Ltd - part-owned by Alibaba - said it made 5 billion yuan in sales within the first 19 minutes.\\n\\nBOON FOR LUXURY\\n\\nSingles’ Day was trending on China’s Twitter-like Weibo, while a poll of Singles’ Day spending by Sina Entertainment found 44% of 174,000 respondents aimed to spend less than 1,000 yuan versus 4% who planned to splurge over 10,000 yuan.\\n\\nStill, analysts expect this year to be a boon for luxury brands, as Chinese consumers accustomed to going overseas to buy high-end goods are stuck at home due to border closures.\\n\\n“The lack of consumer tourism which has hit European and U.S. stalwarts like Harrods, Galeries Lafayette and Nordstroms will likely see bigger spending locally,” retail analyst Andy Halliwell at consultancy Publicis Sapient said in a client note.\\n\\nLivestreaming with telegenic hosts hawking products in real-time was a common feature of this year’s Singles’ Day, continuing a trend which started about two years ago.\\n\\nAt a building close to Alibaba’s Hangzhou headquarters, where rooms had been converted into filming studios, dozens of livestreamers chatted incessantly to viewers about Singles’ Day promotions and the merits of the goods they were selling.\\n\\nLuo Lima, who sells diapers and other maternity products, estimated she had been on camera for 24 hours over the course of this year’s sales period, versus six hours on Singles’ Day two years ago.\\n\\n“We stream continuously for six hours, with no break,” she said. “Basically we start by eating a full meal, and getting in a good state of mind. We also prepare throat lozenges and vitamin drinks.”\\n\\n($1 = 6.6146 Chinese yuan)',\n",

       " {'news': \"FILE PHOTO: Prompts on how to use Amazon's Alexa personal assistant are seen in an Amazon ‘experience centre’ in Vallejo, California, U.S., May 8, 2018. REUTERS/Elijah Nouvelage\\n\\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O on Thursday said it shifted part of the computing for its Alexa voice assistant to its own custom-designed chips, aiming to make the work faster and cheaper while moving it away from chips supplied by Nvidia Corp NVDA.O.\\n\\nWhen users of devices such as Amazon’s Echo line of smart speakers ask the voice assistant a question, the query is sent to one of Amazon’s data centers for several steps of processing. When Amazon’s computers spit out an answer, that reply is in a text format that must be translated into audible speech for the voice assistant.\\n\\nAmazon previously handled that computing using chips from Nvidia but now the “majority” of it will happen using its own “Inferentia” computing chip. First announced in 2018, the Amazon chip is custom designed to speed up large volumes of machine learning tasks such as translating text to speech or recognizing images.\\n\\nCloud computing customers such as Amazon, Microsoft Corp MSFT.O and Alpahbet Inc's GOOGL.O Google have become some of the biggest buyers of computing chips, driving booming data center sales at Intel Corp INTC.O, Nvidia and others.\\n\\nBut major technology companies are increasingly ditching traditional silicon providers to design their own chips. Apple on Tuesday introduced its first Mac computers with its own central processors, moving away from Intel chips. [nL1N2HW1WF}\\n\\nAmazon said the shift to the Infertia chip for some of its Alexa work has resulted in 25% better latency, which is a measure of speed, at a 30% lower cost.\\n\\nAmazon has also said that “Rekognition,” its cloud-based facial recognition service, has started to adopt its own Inferentia chips. However, the company did not say which chips the facial recognition service had previously used or how much of the work had shifted to its own chips.\\n\\nThe service has come under scrutiny from civil rights groups because of its use by law enforcement. Amazon in June put a one-year moratorium its use by police after the killing of George Floyd.\",\n",

       " {'news': 'NEW YORK, Nov 12 (Reuters) - A former Amazon.com Inc worker who protested conditions at his New York City fulfillment center sued the retailer on Thursday, accusing it of discrimination for firing him and for putting Black and Hispanic workers at heightened risk of contracting COVID-19.\\n\\nIn a proposed class action filed in Brooklyn federal court, Christian Smalls accused Amazon of failing to provide needed protective gear to its “predominantly minority” workforce, subjecting them to inferior working conditions than its mainly white managers.\\n\\nCiting a leaked memo from Amazon’s general counsel to Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, Smalls also said Amazon fired him after concluding that as a Black man he was a “weak spokesman” for workers.\\n\\nHe also said Amazon tried to drum up public support by making him the “face” of workers criticizing its pandemic response.\\n\\nThe complaint seeks unspecified damages for Black and Hispanic workers at the Staten Island facility.\\n\\nAmazon did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nIn March and April, Amazon fired Smalls and at least three other workers critical of its pandemic response, citing various alleged workplace violations.\\n\\nIt said Smalls was fired after violating his paid quarantine by joining a protest at the Staten Island facility.\\n\\nA few weeks after the firing, New York Attorney General Letitia James wrote to Amazon, expressing “serious concern” it was trying to silence critics of its health and safety measures.\\n\\nThe Seattle-based company has benefited from the pandemic as consumers shopped online more often.\\n\\nAmazon has said it expects to invest $10 billion this year on COVID-19 initiatives to deliver products and keep employees safe, including by distributing masks to workers and employing disinfectant spraying and temperature checks worldwide.\\n\\nOn Oct. 1, Amazon said 19,816 of its 1.37 million front-line U.S. workers between Mar. 1 and Sept. 19 had tested positive or were presumed positive for the coronavirus.\\n\\nIt said that was 42% fewer than if the infection rate had mirrored the rate for the general population.\\n\\nLast week, a Brooklyn federal judge dismissed a separate lawsuit accusing Amazon of creating a public nuisance at the Staten Island facility.\\n\\nThe case is Smalls v Amazon Inc, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 20-05492.

       " {'news': 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - A former Amazon.com Inc worker who protested conditions at his New York City fulfillment center sued the retailer on Thursday, accusing it of discrimination for firing him and for putting Black and Hispanic workers at heightened risk of contracting COVID-19.\\n\\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\\n\\nIn a proposed class action filed in Brooklyn federal court, Christian Smalls alleged Amazon failed to provide needed protective gear to its “predominantly minority” workforce, subjecting them to inferior working conditions than its mainly white managers.\\n\\nCiting a leaked memo from Amazon’s general counsel to Chief Executive Jeff Bezos, Smalls also said Amazon fired him after concluding that as a Black man he was a “weak spokesman” for workers.\\n\\nHe also said Amazon tried to drum up public support by making him the “face” of workers criticizing its pandemic response.\\n\\nThe complaint seeks unspecified damages for Black and Hispanic workers at the Staten Island facility.\\n\\nAmazon fired Smalls on March 30, saying he joined a protest at the Staten Island facility despite being on paid quarantine, after had having close contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19.\\n\\nIt fired at least three other workers critical of its pandemic response in April, citing various alleged workplace violations.\\n\\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James wrote to Amazon later in April, expressing “serious concern” it was trying to silence critics of its health and safety measures.\\n\\nIn a statement on Thursday, Amazon spokeswoman Lisa Levandowski said Amazon’s focus on customers “is central to our work in diversity and inclusion,” and that Smalls was fired for putting others’ health and safety at risk.\\n\\nThe Seattle-based company has benefited from the pandemic as consumers shopped online more often.\\n\\nAmazon has said it expects to invest $10 billion this year on COVID-19 initiatives to deliver products and keep employees safe, including by distributing masks to workers and employing disinfectant spraying and temperature checks worldwide.\\n\\nOn Oct. 1, Amazon said 19,816 of its 1.37 million front-line U.S. workers between Mar. 1 and Sept. 19 had tested positive or were presumed positive for the coronavirus.\\n\\nIt said that was 42% fewer than if the infection rate had mirrored the rate for the general population.\\n\\nLast week, a Brooklyn federal judge dismissed a separate lawsuit accusing Amazon of creating a public nuisance at the Staten Island facility.\\n\\nThe case is Smalls v Amazon Inc, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 20-05492.',\n",

Curbs include the closure of non-essential stores, restaurants and bars.\\n\\nBut with recent data showing France on track to rein in a surge in coronavirus infections, the government is under pressure from shops and businesses to ease restrictions at the end of November in time for the Christmas shopping season, when many retailers make the bulk of their annual turnover.\\n\\nEager to keep shoppers from crowding stores to swoop on potential discounts, the finance ministry said on Thursday that a one-week delay in Black Friday sales would help ensure shops reopen in France under maximum safety conditions.',\n",

       " {'news': 'OAKLAND, Calif., Nov 20 (Reuters) - Walmart Inc, Best Buy Co Inc and hundreds of smaller retailers are bolstering their online gift features, hoping to challenge Amazon.com Inc’s dominance as a seller of holiday gifts to homebound shoppers.\\n\\nThe new services seek to take some of the drudgery out of gift-giving. The features let consumers purchase a present online and have it delivered to the recipient with, for example, the retailer handling wrapping, a personal message or a receipt that does not show the gift’s price.\\n\\nAmazon’s rivals have tried to chip away at its online preeminence, spending millions to fulfill orders faster, expand product catalogs and, in some cases, provide free shipping and even subscription services. But the first holiday sales season with widespread coronavirus has drawn attention to a previously overlooked battlefront: gift giving.\\n\\nConsumers flocked to Walmart and other retailers early in the pandemic when Amazon was at times slow to deliver essentials including toilet paper. Now, Amazon competitors see another opportunity to seize market share.\\n\\n“This is an area of opportunity where smaller or large retailers could differentiate given most consumers will be doing their holiday shopping online this year,” said Bobby Figueroa, who worked for Amazon’s ad sales unit before founding retail analytics startup Gradient.\\n\\nWalmart.com on Oct. 28 added a “gift eligible” label on hundreds of thousands of U.S. product pages, including for toilet paper, a status previously not displayed until checkout. Gift eligible means Walmart can send gift receipts as well as let shoppers customize an email greeting. It will also ship the item in its boxes, concealing manufacturer packaging.\\n\\nWith gift giving already up over last year, Walmart increased inventory of laptops, loungewear and exercise equipment ahead of the holidays. Shoppers can search specifically for only gift-eligible items for the first time.\\n\\nBestBuy.com in mid-October added an option for gift receipts with store pickups. It also started allowing shoppers to arrange for Best Buy to email gift recipients with a festive greeting on the same day items are delivered.\\n\\nEstee Lauder Companies Inc this year is using technology from startup SmartGift that added options across five of its websites for shoppers to designate cosmetics and other items as gifts while letting recipients select color, size or scent before shipping.\\n\\nAmericans will spend $160 billion on gifts during the current quarter, up 5% from a year ago as people put savings from skipped outings into celebrating Christmas and other year-end holidays, according to industry analyst Coresight Research.\\n\\nAdobe Inc’s e-commerce software unit Magento expects Americans to ship 67% more holiday gifts than a year ago and to 18% more recipients as travel gets curbed.\\n\\nBut Coresight still expects Amazon.com to capture 18% of gift purchases and 7.2% of overall U.S. retail sales, up from 14% of gift purchases and 5.6% of total sales in 2019.\\n\\nAmazon has maintained its dominance as the entire ecommerce industry thrives in the pandemic. Amazon’s product sales rose 32% this year through September, nearly 2-1/2 times the rate over the same period last year.\\n\\nIt pushed its annual sales event Prime Day to October from July as an early start to holiday shopping, and it brought forward the release of its annual guide of potential gifts to just before. The guide, which included new sections for items from small and Black-owned businesses, was Amazon’s largest ever.\\n\\nThe company has long provided basic gift features. It charges several dollars to gift-wrap shipments, and a free message of up to 240 characters per item can be printed on black-and-white gift receipts. A year ago, it started offering emailed gift receipts for some items.\\n\\nMYSTERIOUS SENDER\\n\\nBut some consumers are frustrated that Amazon does not offer options others do, such as the ability to specify delivery date or gift wrap color, have recipients enter their shipping address or send gift messages by text, video and physical card.\\n\\n“The gift thing on Amazon is completely broken,” said Lawrence Greenberg, 54, a financial planner in New Hope, Pennsylvania. He said he will buy elsewhere when possible after four of his gift recipients over the last three years either did not notice or receive the printed gift message. Just last month, a client puzzled for two weeks over who sent cocktail glasses until Greenberg asked.\\n\\nAmazon said its gift features remain popular.\\n\\nJeff Jordan, 33, of Charlotte, shipped three Amazon purchases to himself this month, with plans to wrap and re-ship the gifts. He lost faith in Amazon last year when it wrapped a gadget for his parents in a gray plastic sleeve with a tiny gift tag and a wad of tissue paper.\\n\\nThough Amazon apologized and refunded, Jordan said he “learned his lesson.” (Reporting by Paresh Dave; Additional reporting by Melissa Fares in New York and Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)',\n",

       " {'news': \"OAKLAND, Calif. (Reuters) - Walmart Inc WMT.N, Best Buy Co Inc BBY.N and hundreds of smaller retailers are bolstering their online gift features, hoping to challenge Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O dominance as a seller of holiday gifts to homebound shoppers.\\n\\nAn Amazon.com Inc worker prepares an order in which the buyer asked for an item to be gift wrapped at a fulfillment center in Shakopee, Minnesota, U.S., November 12, 2020. Amazon.com Inc/Handout via REUTERS\\n\\nThe new services seek to take some of the drudgery out of gift-giving. The features let consumers purchase a present online and have it delivered to the recipient with, for example, the retailer handling wrapping, a personal message or a receipt that does not show the gift’s price.\\n\\nAmazon’s rivals have tried to chip away at its online preeminence, spending millions to fulfill orders faster, expand product catalogs and, in some cases, provide free shipping and even subscription services. But the first holiday sales season with widespread coronavirus has drawn attention to a previously overlooked battlefront: gift giving.\\n\\nConsumers flocked to Walmart and other retailers early in the pandemic when Amazon was at times slow to deliver essentials including toilet paper. Now, Amazon competitors see another opportunity to seize market share.\\n\\n“This is an area of opportunity where smaller or large retailers could differentiate given most consumers will be doing their holiday shopping online this year,” said Bobby Figueroa, who worked for Amazon’s ad sales unit before founding retail analytics startup Gradient.\\n\\nWalmart.com on Oct. 28 added a “gift eligible” label on hundreds of thousands of U.S. product pages, including for toilet paper, a status previously not displayed until checkout. Gift eligible means Walmart can send gift receipts as well as let shoppers customize an email greeting. It will also ship the item in its boxes, concealing manufacturer packaging.\\n\\nWith gift giving already up over last year, Walmart increased inventory of laptops, loungewear and exercise equipment ahead of the holidays. Shoppers can search specifically for only gift-eligible items for the first time.\\n\\nBestBuy.com in mid-October added an option for gift receipts with store pickups. It also started allowing shoppers to arrange for Best Buy to email gift recipients with a festive greeting on the same day items are delivered.\\n\\nEstee Lauder Companies Inc EL.N this year is using technology from startup SmartGift that added options across five of its websites for shoppers to designate cosmetics and other items as gifts while letting recipients select color, size or scent before shipping.\\n\\nSlideshow ( 4 images )\\n\\nAmericans will spend $160 billion on gifts during the current quarter, up 5% from a year ago as people put savings from skipped outings into celebrating Christmas and other year-end holidays, according to industry analyst Coresight Research.\\n\\nAdobe Inc's ADBE.O e-commerce software unit Magento expects Americans to ship gifts to 18% more recipients than a year ago as travel gets curbed.\\n\\nBut Coresight still expects Amazon.com to capture 18% of gift purchases and 7.2% of overall U.S. retail sales, up from 14% of gift purchases and 5.6% of total sales in 2019.\\n\\nAmazon has maintained its dominance as the entire ecommerce industry thrives in the pandemic. Amazon’s product sales rose 32% this year through September, nearly 2-1/2 times the rate over the same period last year.\\n\\nIt pushed its annual sales event Prime Day to October from July as an early start to holiday shopping, and it brought forward the release of its annual guide of potential gifts to just before. The guide, which included new sections for items from small and Black-owned businesses, was Amazon’s largest ever.\\n\\nThe company has long provided basic gift features. It charges several dollars to gift-wrap shipments, and a free message of up to 240 characters per item can be printed on black-and-white gift receipts. A year ago, it started offering emailed gift receipts and messages for some items, with links to let recipients initiate a return and send a thank you note.\\n\\nMYSTERIOUS SENDER\\n\\nBut some consumers are frustrated that Amazon does not offer options others do, such as the ability to specify delivery date or gift wrap color, have recipients enter their shipping address or send gift messages by text, video and physical card.\\n\\n“The gift thing on Amazon is completely broken,” said Lawrence Greenberg, 54, a financial planner in New Hope, Pennsylvania. He said he will buy elsewhere when possible after four of his gift recipients over the last three years either did not notice or receive the printed gift message. Just last month, a client puzzled for two weeks over who sent cocktail glasses until Greenberg asked.\\n\\nAmazon said its gift features remain popular.\\n\\nJeff Jordan, 33, of Charlotte, shipped three Amazon purchases to himself this month, with plans to wrap and re-ship the gifts. He lost faith in Amazon last year when it wrapped a gadget for his parents in a gray plastic sleeve with a tiny gift tag and a wad of tissue paper.\\n\\nThough Amazon apologized and refunded, Jordan said he “learned his lesson.”\",\n",

       " {'news': 'NEW DELHI/MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s National Stock Exchange (NSE) privately warned Future Retail it risked regulatory action for not making timely market disclosures about efforts by Amazon.com to block a disputed asset sale, according to e-mails reviewed by Reuters.\\n\\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\\n\\nFuture Retail - one of country’s top retailers - has been locked in a bitter dispute with Amazon over its $3.4 billion retail assets deal with Reliance Industries. Amazon is a business partner of Future and argues the Indian firm’s asset sale breached some of their pre-existing agreements.\\n\\nAmazon had complained to stock exchanges, accusing Future of misleading public by making incorrect market disclosures, allegations the Indian group denies.\\n\\nThe complaint came after Amazon on Oct. 25 won an injunction from an arbitrator to halt the Future-Reliance deal.\\n\\nPreviously unreported e-mails exchanged between the NSE and Future show the stock exchange repeatedly requested the company submit more details of the arbitration order, seeking details of possible impact on financials, lenders and the Reliance deal.\\n\\nOn Oct. 27, NSE asked Future why it had not disclosed the commencement of the arbitration proceedings and not shared the impact of the order. Future in response said it believed a disclosure wasn’t required.\\n\\nNSE’s listing compliance division rejected that argument. It demanded a series of disclosures be made within hours, “failing which appropriate actions may be initiated”, the emails showed.\\n\\nFuture Retail’s Company Secretary, Virendra Samani, answered most of NSE’s queries in a late night e-mail on Oct. 30, saying it was doing so “in the best interest of all stakeholders”, the communications showed.\\n\\nMany of those responses were made public on directions of the NSE two days later in a six-page exchange filing by Future.\\n\\nBefore that, Future had only submitted a disclosure on Oct. 26 in which it attached a media release saying it would ensure its deal with Reliance proceeded unhindered and that it was reviewing the arbitration order.\\n\\nThe NSE and Future Retail did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nThe legal dispute has now reached the Delhi High Court, where Future Retail has urged the court to stop Amazon from writing letters to regulators to block its Reliance deal, which is pending approvals from the market regulator and stock exchanges. The judge is expected to rule on the plea in the coming days.\\n\\nAmazon had separately asked India’s market regulator to investigate Future for insider trading, saying it disclosed to Reliance price sensitive details of the arbitration order before its exchange filing in late October.\\n\\nFuture has said its communications with Reliance, which is led by Asia’s richest man Mukesh Ambani, were for a “legitimate purpose”.\\n\\nNSE in e-mails at least twice asked Future Retail to provide a copy of the arbitration order to vet the disclosures, and also why it should not be disclosed as material price-sensitive information, emails between Oct. 27 and Oct. 30 showed.\\n\\nFuture’s Samani at first declined the request, stating in an e-mail that the order was “confidential in nature” and sharing further information could be “deterimental” to the company. A copy was provided following NSE’s warning.',\n",

REUTERS/Niharika Kulkarni\\n\\nThe outcome of a legal dispute which has embroiled the billionaires’ Amazon.com and Reliance Industries Ltd empires - where a court ruling is imminent - may shape India’s retail landscape for years to come.\\n\\nThe winner in the fight for Future Retail Ltd, Amazon’s estranged local partner, will get pole position in the race to meet the daily needs of more than a billion people.\\n\\nAccusations of insider trading and contractual breaches, as well as nationalistic cries to keep the U.S. giant at bay, mark the high-stakes fight, which has snowballed from what began as a dispute between Amazon and Future.\\n\\nIf Amazon succeeds, it may slow Reliance’s plans to expand its e-commerce and brick-and-mortar operations. If Amazon loses, its hopes of expanding its interests in India’s second-largest retailer and cashing in on its key grocery supply chain will be dashed, industry insiders say.\\n\\nAmazon is trying to stop Reliance’s $3.4 billion purchase of Future Group’s retail assets. The U.S. company, which won an injunction from an arbitrator to block the Reliance-Future deal, accuses its partner of breaching some pre-existing agreements, misleading the public and insider trading. Future denies the allegations.\\n\\nAmazon, Reliance and Future did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nBezos’s behemoth is a formidable foe, but Ambani has a history as a disrupter. He has shaken foreign telecom firms by offering dirt-cheap data. Industry executives see his e-commerce plans as a threat for Amazon and Walmart Inc’s Flipkart.\\n\\n“If Reliance moves faster and faster, obviously it’ll become very difficult for anyone else to gain,” said Himanshu Bajaj, head of consulting firm Kearney’s India retail practice.\\n\\nReliance, seeking to expand its JioMart e-commerce business, this month completed a $6.4 billion fund-raising by selling a stake in its retail arm to such investors as Silver Lake Partners and KKR & Co.\\n\\nGROCERIES, ‘BIG BROTHER’ IN AMERICA\\n\\nIndia’s retail market will grow 46% over the next four years to an annual $1.3 trillion, reckons Forrester Research. The key battle is over groceries, expected to be worth around $740 billion a year by 2024.\\n\\nFounded by Kishore Biyani, dubbed India’s retail king, Future transformed the country’s retailing in recent decades, before COVID-19 hit the business so hard this year that Biyani was forced to find a new buyer.\\n\\nAround 1,300 of Future’s more than 1,700 retail outlets in 400 cities sell groceries. Its budget supermarkets cater to middle-class shoppers, while its upmarket stores offer products like imported cheese and fresh guacamole, relatively rare in India’s retail landscape.\\n\\nThat makes Future a prized asset for both Reliance and Amazon.\\n\\nReliance and Future dominate the market, with the next competitor, Avenue Supermarts Ltd’s DMart, having just 220 outlets in around 70 cities.\\n\\nWhile Reliance boasts around 11,000 retail stores, just 800 of those offer food and groceries, UBS estimates. Future’s retail assets would nearly triple Reliance’s footprint in the grocery segment and boost its e-commerce plans, said Forrester analyst Satish Meena.\\n\\nAmazon sees Future as a long-term play to optimise its supply chain for grocery delivery, an area where it has lagged, Meena said.\\n\\n“Grocery is the category in which you fight,” he said, while losing Future to Reliance would “slow Amazon”.\\n\\nAmazon, Future and Reliance this month hired some of India’s top lawyers, who argued at length before a New Delhi judge. She is expected to decide soon whether to restrain Amazon from approaching regulators to block the Future-Reliance deal.\\n\\nAmid heated legal arguments and patriotic appeals, Future’s lawyer attacked Amazon as “Big Brother” in America, arguing Future faces bankruptcy if the Reliance deal fails.\\n\\n“Please don’t allow this American giant to kill Future,” the lawyer urged the judge.',\n",

U.K. grocer Morrisons is one such example.\\n\\nVoice authentication is AWS’ latest work in the field of biometrics, which has attracted criticism from civil liberties advocates.

       " {'news': '(Reuters) -California Attorney General Xavier Becerra on Monday petitioned a court to force Amazon.com Inc to comply with outstanding subpoenas over a state investigation into its handling of the coronavirus pandemic.\\n\\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\\n\\nThe petition, filed with the Sacramento County Superior Court, accused Amazon of failing to adequately follow the state’s information requests as part of an investigation into the company’s coronavirus protocols and status of COVID-19 cases at its California facilities.\\n\\n“Amazon has delayed responding adequately to our investigative requests long enough,” Becerra, President-elect Joe Biden’s pick to serve as U.S. secretary of health and human services, said in the petition.\\n\\nThe subpoenas seek information about Amazon’s sick-leave policies, sanitation measures and data about the spread of the virus at the company’s California warehouses, the petition said.\\n\\nJodi Seth, an Amazon spokeswoman, said in a statement the company has been cooperating with Becerra’s office for months.\\n\\n“We’re puzzled by the attorney general’s sudden rush to court. ... Their claims of noncompliance with their demands don’t line up with the facts,” Seth said.\\n\\nSeth said the company has invested heavily in on-site testing for employees and personal protective equipment during the pandemic.\\n\\nThe attorney general’s investigation into Amazon dates to the spring of this year, when news about working conditions at Amazon’s in-state facilities raised concern, according to the petition.\\n\\nThe Guardian reported in May that Amazon had denied some requests for paid sick leave that worker activists alleged violated a California law giving two weeks’ time to staff at facilities where food is stored, like Amazon’s. The pro-worker group IE Amazonians Unite said it contacted state officials on the matter and that ultimately Amazon notified personnel about the paid leave opportunity.\\n\\nAmazon has said it complied with state law. More than 19,000 of its U.S. staff have contracted COVID-19, Amazon said in October.',\n",

       " {'news': 'Slideshow ( 2 images )\\n\\n(Reuters) -Amazon.com Inc on Wednesday asked the U.S. government to prioritize essential workers including its warehouse, grocery store and data center staff for receipt of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to a letter seen by Reuters.\\n\\nThe request shows how the country’s second-biggest private employer, with 800,000 workers in the United States, considers the vaccine important to keeping its staff safe and its facilities open. The U.S. National Retail Federation made a similar request on the industry’s behalf Wednesday as well.\\n\\nAdministration of the vaccine began Monday in the United States, following emergency-use authorization last week. Early doses have been set aside for healthcare workers and nursing home residents.\\n\\nDave Clark, Amazon’s senior vice president of worldwide operations, said the company supports giving the vaccine to healthcare professionals and that essential workers should come next, in line with a government vaccine playbook from October. His letter was addressed to the head of an advisory panel at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, called ACIP.\\n\\n“We request that ACIP continue to prioritize these essential workers who cannot work from home, like those working at Amazon fulfillment centers, AWS data centers and Whole Foods Market stores, to receive the COVID-19 vaccine at the earliest appropriate time,” he wrote. Amazon owns the grocery chain Whole Foods and operates the cloud computing business AWS.\\n\\nThe letter was earlier reported by the Wall Street Journal.',\n",

REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol/File Photo\\n\\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said on Sunday it had closed one of its warehouses in New Jersey out of caution till Dec. 26, after seeing an increase in asymptomatic positive cases amongst workers.\\n\\n“Through our in-house COVID-19 testing program, we detected an increase in the number of asymptomatic positive cases at our PNE5 facility in northern New Jersey and have proactively closed the site until December 26th out of an abundance of caution,” an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement to Reuters.\\n\\nAmazon, the world’s largest online retailer, said it isn’t anticipating any impacts to operations or deliveries due to this shutdown.\\n\\nIt did not specify the number of workers who contracted the disease at its PNE5 facility, which is a sorting center.\\n\\nThe company, however said, that its employees will be paid for the shifts that they miss because of the shutdown of the facility.\\n\\nIn October, Amazon said more than 19,000 of its U.S. frontline workers contracted the coronavirus this year, or 1.44% of the total, a disclosure sought by labor advocates who have criticized the COVID-19 response of the company.\\n\\nSome staff, elected officials and unions in recent months have said Amazon put its employees’ health at risk by keeping warehouses open during the pandemic.\\n\\nThe company had said it would expand virus testing to 50,000 U.S. employees per day by November through internally built capacity.',\n",

       " {'news': 'MUMBAI (Reuters) - The High Court of Delhi on Monday left it to regulators to decide the fate of the $3.38 billion sale of Future Group’s retail assets to Reliance Industries Ltd, but allowed U.S. partner Amazon.com Inc to raise objections to it.\\n\\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\\n\\nHammered by the coronavirus pandemic, Future sold its retail assets to oil-to-clothes conglomerate Reliance in August but Amazon said the deal breached agreements Future made with the U.S. ecommerce leader in 2019.\\n\\nAnalysts expect the Reliance deal, which has now cleared anti-trust hurdles, to go through despite the High Court of Delhi on Monday dismissing a plea from Future to restrain Amazon - which owns a small indirect stake in Future Retail - from interfering in the transaction.\\n\\nThe pursuit of Future Retail Ltd has been billed as the battle of the billionaires - namely Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Reliance’s Mukesh Ambani.\\n\\nIf the deal with Reliance goes ahead, it will delay Amazon’s goal of capturing India’s massive groceries market that Forrester Research estimates will be worth $740 billion a year by 2024.\\n\\n“The present application is disposed of ...” the court said in its written order about the Future petition.\\n\\n“However, the Statutory Authorities/Regulators are directed to take the decision on the applications/objections in accordance with the law.”\\n\\nAmazon emailed a one-line statement welcoming the verdict, while Future said it was consulting with legal advisors.\\n\\n“It is being portrayed that just because the interim injunction has not been granted, this round has gone to Amazon, which is not true,” said Shweta Dubey, partner at legal firm SD Partners.\\n\\n“There have been certain significant observations in the judgement which have put Future in a very advantageous position.”\\n\\nThe court said Reliance and Future’s agreement “satisfies the requirement of a valid contract”, although Justice Mukta Gupta noted in the verdict that Amazon cannot be barred from writing to regulators on account of potentially irreparable damage.\\n\\nReliance and Future dominate India’s grocery market, with the next competitor, Avenue Supermarts Ltd’s DMart, far behind in terms of stores and reach.\\n\\nFuture is widely credited as transforming India’s retail sector in recent decades. However, Kishore Biyani sought a buyer after its stores bore the brunt of virus related lockdowns.\\n\\n“Even if money-wise Amazon can invest as much as Reliance, you will need still time to build the infrastructure on ground,” said Satish Meena, senior Forrester forecast analyst, of Amazon’s grocery ambitions in the country.\\n\\n“That is something that Amazon will need to do from scratch or acquire or tie-up with other Indian grocery or retailers.”',\n",

       " {'news': 'Slideshow ( 3 images )\\n\\nLOS ANGELES/LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon seller Bernie Thompson shifted half of his production out of China to reduce his business risks and still found himself in the crosshairs of logistical chaos besetting the movement of goods around the globe.\\n\\nA surge in demand for furniture, exercise equipment and other goods for shoppers sheltering at home in a worsening COVID-19 pandemic has upended normal trade flows.\\n\\nThat has stranded empty cargo containers in the wrong places, spawning bottlenecks that now stretch from factories to seaports. Container ship operators ferry the majority of consumer goods, and transportation and trade sources warn that prolonged industry disruption could cause shortages and complicate the global economic recovery. Thompson, founder of Washington-based Plugable Technologies, sells work-from-home staples like laptop docking stations. He diversified sourcing to be less reliant on a single country for manufacturing and less exposed to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods.\\n\\nThings did not go as planned and now, like many other importers, he is concerned about keeping enough product in stock. “We’ve moved production out of China and moved ourselves right into a disadvantage,” said Thompson.\\n\\nHis new factory in Thailand was first to suffer delays of about four weeks, in part because shipping companies routed empty containers to the top priority U.S.-China trade lane. Those logistical snags cascaded and now his remaining shipments from China - the world’s No. 1 manufacturer – are postponed by as much as three weeks. And he is not alone - U.S. retailer Costco Wholesale Corp and Honda Motor Co Ltd in the United Kingdom have also suffered delays. “Everyone’s trying to squeeze through this narrow opening all at once,” said Rick Woldenberg, chief executive of Illinois-based Learning Resources which supplies educational toys to Amazon.com and other major retailers. It can “really screw up your plans,” he said. Container ships have been sailing at full load since August – something that has not happened in a decade, said Peter Sand, chief shipping analyst with trade association BIMCO.\\n\\nRolf Habben Jansen, chief executive of Germany’s Hapag-Lloyd, told investors that the container line was “deploying every available ship”. MOUNTING FRUSTRATION Frustration is building. Importers and exporters are “upset they’re not able to move their product or crop as willingly as they would like to,” said Gene Seroka, executive director of Port of Los Angeles – the busiest U.S. seaport. “We need to get the trade flow going to grease the engine for the whole world economy,” said Christopher Tang, a business professor at the University of California-Los Angeles. Port staffing reductions due to COVID safety rules also play a part.\\n\\n“It’s a combination of strong volume and slower and less efficient operations,” said Lars Mikael Jensen, head of network with Denmark’s A.P.

       " {'news': '(Reuters) - In 2021, Amazon.com Inc is poised to face a renewed challenge from groups it has long countered: unions.\\n\\nEnergized by protests at Amazon’s U.S. warehouses and a more labor-friendly administration assuming office, unions are campaigning at the world’s largest online retailer to see if its warehouse or grocery workers would like to join their ranks.\\n\\nA major test is expected early next year when workers at one warehouse decide whether to unionize. The company has not faced a union election in the United States since 2014, and a “yes” vote would be the first ever for a U.S. Amazon facility.\\n\\nAmazon, America’s second-biggest private employer behind Walmart Inc, has told workers it already offers the pay and benefits unions promise, and it has trained managers to spot organizing activity. Its operation in France offers a picture of what the company would avoid: strong unions there precipitated a month-long closure of its warehouses this year.\\n\\nThe upcoming vote is for associates in Amazon’s fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama; they will weigh whether to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). The organizing committee has launched a social media campaign, shared union authorization cards and collected enough to hold the election.\\n\\nThis week and last, the RWDSU and Amazon negotiated the election terms. By Tuesday they agreed to have seasonal workers in the bargaining unit, as well as process assistants, whose inclusion the union had questioned for their supervisory authority, according to the election hearings presided by a government labor board. That board will set the election date.\\n\\nThe larger the bargaining unit’s size - now expected to be over 5,700 - the more votes the union needs to win.\\n\\nIn a statement, Amazon said, “We don’t believe this group represents the majority of our employees’ views. Our employees choose to work at Amazon because we offer some of the best jobs available everywhere we hire.” Average pay at the Bessemer facility is $15.30 per hour, and jobs come with health and retirement benefits, it said.\\n\\nPrecedent shows the RWDSU faces an uphill battle. Union membership has fallen to 10% of the eligible workforce in 2019 from 20% in 1983, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported in January.\\n\\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\\n\\nEmployees at the Alabama facility did not answer requests for an interview.\\n\\nVOTE ‘WOULD PASS’\\n\\nAmazon workers are organizing elsewhere, too. Alexander Collias, a cashier for Amazon’s subsidiary Whole Foods, said he has been participating in walkouts because the pandemic has put workers’ health at risk and he claims management has brushed off others concerns.\\n\\n“We’re definitely extremely pro-union,” he said of his Whole Foods store in Portland. “If we had a vote today, I think it would pass.”\\n\\nCourtenay Brown, a process assistant at an Amazon warehouse in New Jersey, said work has increased 10-fold in her building during the pandemic, and colleagues have fallen ill. So she’s started circulating work-related petitions via Facebook.\\n\\n“We need to be able to have a voice,” said Brown, 30, adding she was neutral about the impact a union could have at her facility.\\n\\nReuters was introduced to both Brown and Collias via pro-labor groups campaigning at Amazon. One of them was Whole Worker, a group of current and former Whole Foods staff looking to organize the grocery chain.\\n\\nIts strategy is to focus outreach and actions at the half dozen Whole Foods stores, including in Portland and Wauwatosa, Wisconsin, where it already has secured majority staff support, said Katie Doan, one of the group’s directors.\\n\\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\\n\\n“We’d rather focus on little stores here and there who are for sure going to fully unionize, rather than fail nationally,” said Doan, who worked for Whole Foods in California until earlier this year.\\n\\nLikewise, representatives of the United Food and Commercial Workers International have reached out to discuss unionization, hazard pay and other issues with Whole Foods staff, according to interviews and copies of the communication shared with Reuters.\\n\\nSeattle-area unions are meeting with Amazon tech workers, too, their coalition leader said. One local is helping corporate whistleblowers whom Amazon fired contest their termination as a violation of U.S. labor law, according to a public record obtained by Reuters. Amazon said it supports workers’ right to criticize the company, but the employees in question violated internal policies.\\n\\nLabor advocates say the administration of President Joe Biden is poised to help with union efforts, making the U.S. National Labor Relations Board less beholden to corporate interests and supporting the Protecting the Right to Organize (PRO) Act.\\n\\nThat bill passed the U.S. House in February and would add penalties for companies that hinder organizing; Senate approval is far from guaranteed. Its passage would help level the playing field for workers, said Stuart Appelbaum, RWDSU president whose Mid-South Council is behind the Alabama union drive.\\n\\n“With a change in administration, Amazon workers are going to have a much better chance of coming together,” he said.',\n",

REUTERS/Pascal Rossignol//File Photo\\n\\nThe inception of Haven had jolted the shares of several healthcare companies that feared that Amazon might disrupt traditional insurance and drug benefit businesses.\\n\\nThe not-for-profit venture was meant to address high costs in the world’s most expensive healthcare system and to initially focus on “transparent” healthcare for the U.S. employees of the three companies.\\n\\nBut the joint venture faced hurdles last year when its Chief Executive Officer Atul Gawande, a Harvard surgeon and author, stepped down to take the role of chairman.\\n\\nThe announcement about the role change was the first public statement by the company since it unveiled its name in 2019.\\n\\nHaven said on Monday the three companies would in the future collaborate informally to design programs tailored to address the specific needs of their own employees.\\n\\nCNBC, which first reported the company was winding down, said many projects designed by Haven were executed separately by the three companies, eliminating the need for a joint venture.\\n\\nDespite a premature end to Haven, Amazon’s ambition to disrupt healthcare remains, Evercore ISI analysts said in a client note.\\n\\nThe e-commerce giant had in November launched an online pharmacy for delivering prescription medications in the United States.\\n\\n“Even without the formal JV, Berkshire and JP Morgan could still remain important partners/customers for Amazon’s healthcare offerings with large employee bases,” Evercore analysts said.',\n",

Pence did not, and Congress confirmed Biden’s win.',\n",

The Indian retailer has maintained that order is not binding and has instead mounted another legal challenge in a New Delhi court.\\n\\nIn December, the Indian court left it to regulators to decide the fate of Future Group’s retail deal with Reliance, but allowed Amazon to raise objections to the sale.\\n\\nIn its appeal, Amazon is arguing that certain observations made by the judge in relation to the terms of the U.S. company’s 2019 agreement with Future were inconsistent with the Singapore arbitrator’s order, which favoured Amazon, the source said.\\n\\nThe source also said Amazon is arguing in its appeal that this has allowed Future to effectively bypass the arbitration order. The appeal is due to be heard on Jan. 13.\\n\\nFuture Group and Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nThe appeal comes after Future Group CEO Kishore Biyani told Reuters in an interview over the weekend he expects swift regulatory approval for the deal.\",\n",

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid./File Photo\\n\\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Parler, a social media outlet favored by some supporters of U.S. President Donald Trump, urged a court Wednesday to order Amazon.com Inc to put it back online.\\n\\nAmazon had shut down Parler following the Jan. 6 riot by Trump supporters at the Capitol aimed at preventing Democrat Joe Biden from becoming president. Parler filed a lawsuit against Amazon on Jan. 11, accusing it of making an illegal decision to shut it down to benefit Twitter Inc\\n\\nIn its filing, Parler argued that Amazon Web Services breached its contract by cutting it off. Amazon earlier had said it had warned Parler about ugly and threatening language on its site, citing posts with vile language used to describe former first lady Michelle Obama, as well as postings such as “the only good democrat is a dead one. Kill’em all.”\\n\\nParler defended the insults to Obama as hateful but covered by the Constitution. The threat, the respondent said, “has been passed on to our regulator contact for investigation.”\\n\\nIn its filing Wednesday, Parler said it had removed most problematic posts.\\n\\nA second exhibit showed Parler postings that threatened specific acts of violence against people, some of whom are named while others are described as “liberals” or black, gay, Jewish or transgender.\\n\\n“We explained that given the events at the U.S. Capitol Building and the threats regarding the upcoming inauguration, we had real concern about this content leading to more violence,” an unnamed Amazon executive said in a statement included with the exhibits, referring to Biden’s inauguration on Jan 20.\\n\\nParler CEO John Matze said in an interview with Reuters that he was unsure if the app, which had more than 12 million users, will ever go back online. “It could be never,” he said.\\n\\nSeparately, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton sent civil subpoenas to Amazon, as well as Google and Apple, which had dropped Parler from their app stores. Paxton said he was seeking to learn if the companies sought to “eliminate speech they disagree with.”\",\n",

       " {'news': '(Reuters) - There’s a lot going on in the complaint the conservative microblogging service Parler filed Monday against Amazon Web Services in federal court in Seattle.\\n\\nAs you surely know, Amazon disclosed on Jan. 10 that it was suspending its web-hosting services for Parler because, in Amazon’s view, Parler had failed to respond to a steady increase in violent content after the Jan. 6 riot on Capitol Hill. Parler alleged in its lawsuit the next day and in an accompanying motion for a temporary restraining order that Amazon, driven by “political animus” and a desire to boost Parler’s competitor Twitter, had sabotaged Parler at precisely the moment that Parler was poised for explosive growth. Parler counsel David Groesbeck accused Amazon of violating federal antitrust law in addition to breach of contract, arguing that Amazon’s actions illegally favored Twitter.\\n\\nAmazon’s lawyers at Davis Wright Tremaine filed the company’s brief opposing the TRO Tuesday night. Citing scores of chilling posts by Parler users - including vivid threats of violence to politicians, social media executives, journalists, Amazon delivery drivers, even teachers – Amazon argued that it was Parler, not Amazon, that had breached their agreement. Amazon’s terms of service, the brief said, prohibit content that “violates the rights of others, or that may be harmful to others.” If its web services customers violate those terms, Amazon said, it has the right to suspend or terminate their accounts immediately. And, according to Amazon, it gave Parler plenty of opportunity to come up with protocols to comply with Amazon rules, as an Amazon executive recounted in a redacted declaration. (Amazon said it had redacted the name of the executive for fear its employee would be attacked.) Parler’s response – an inchoate plan to use volunteers to identify dangerous posts – was inadequate, Amazon said.\\n\\nAmazon also pointed to Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, the clause conservatives love to hate. Section 230, as you know, restricts liability for online service providers. In this case, Amazon said, it precludes Parler’s claims because Amazon acted in good faith. Under Section 230, Amazon said, it can’t be liable for acting in good faith to block violent and harassing content.\\n\\nBut for me, Amazon’s most interesting argument refuted Parler’s allegation that Amazon violated the Sherman Act by favoring Twitter, even though, according to Parler, Twitter’s content can be just as violent and abusive as posts on Parler. The pleading standard for federal antitrust claims, as Amazon’s Davis Wright lawyers said in their brief, is notoriously strict after the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2007 ruling in Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly (550 U.S. 544). Antitrust plaintiffs must plausibly allege an anticompetitive conspiracy. But Parler didn’t even allege that Amazon and Twitter ever discussed Parler, let alone that they had an agreement to squelch the right-leaning site.\\n\\nAmazon provided a declaration (also redacted) from an executive who negotiated the company’s recently announced agreement with Twitter. Amazon had previously been providing web hosting services for ancillary Twitter services, like data backup and Twitter’s new Fleets feature, but not for Twitter’s main feed. Under the new agreement, announced in December, Amazon will begin hosting Twitter’s main feed at an unspecified future date. But according to the executive, the negotiations with Twitter did not touch upon Parler.\\n\\n“To my knowledge, (Amazon) and Twitter have never discussed, much less agreed upon, any policy, practice, or act directed at Parler,” the executive said. “To the contrary, we have an internal policy never to discuss matters involving one customer with another customer. Nobody in my organization would be authorized to discuss Parler with Twitter without my authorization (and) I have not authorized any AWS employee to discuss Parler with Twitter.”\\n\\nThere’s also a very good reason, according to Amazon, why Amazon would not have conspired with Twitter to thwart Parler: Amazon has no motive to pick between them. It’s in the business of providing web services to any customer, regardless of political views, that’s willing to comply with its terms, its executive said in the redacted declaration.\\n\\n“AWS has no incentive to stop doing business with paying customers,” Davis Wright wrote in Amazon’s brief. It only suspended Parler’s account, the brief said, because Parler violated Amazon’s terms by failing to offer a systemic plan to take down violent and abusive posts.\\n\\nStanford law professor Mark Lemley told my Reuters colleague Tom Rowe that Parler’s antitrust theory just doesn’t seem plausible. “It would be one thing if there were evidence that Amazon, Twitter and Facebook conspired together to target Parler,” Lemley said. “But Amazon acting alone isn’t an antitrust problem … Amazon has a general right to refuse to deal with anyone for any reason, or indeed no reason at all.”\\n\\nParler’s reply brief, filed Wednesday afternoon, argued that circumstantial evidence backs its claim that Amazon acted in the interest of Twitter, a much bigger and wealthier client than Parler. Amazon only began threatening to shut down Parler web services when users began switching en masse from Twitter to Parler, the brief said. That timing, coupled with Amazon’s tolerance for violent posts by Twitter users, suggests a conspiracy to promote Twitter at Parler’s expense.\\n\\nParler also said Amazon and Twitter had “a clear interest in\\n\\neliminating an up-and-coming service like Parler,” although the brief did not directly respond to Amazon’s argument that it’s happy to take money from any customer that complies with its terms. Parler said Amazon engaged in anticompetitive conduct by erasing its site from the microblogging market.\\n\\nU.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein will preside over a hearing on Parler’s TRO motion tomorrow.\\n\\nParler and its users are convinced there’s a double standard. As the company complained in its filings, Twitter users also post violent threats: Just the day before Amazon suspended Parler, #HangMikePence was a trending topic on Twitter. (Amazon’s brief explained that it does not currently provide web hosting services to Twitter’s main feed, so it could not have threatened suspension. It also said that Twitter subsequently blocked the hashtag.)\\n\\nBut Amazon’s apparently unilateral decision to boot Parler does not constitute an antitrust conspiracy. Without additional evidence, Parler’s Sherman Act claim is not going to get the site reinstated through Amazon web services.',\n",

       " {'news': '(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc’s first U.S. union election since 2014 is scheduled to begin with the mailing of ballots in early February and a vote count starting March 30, a U.S. labor board official said in a filing on Friday.\\n\\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\\n\\nThe announcement brings employees at Amazon’s fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama, a step closer to deciding whether to join part of the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). A “yes” vote would mark the first-ever for a U.S. Amazon facility.\\n\\nUnions have had greater success organizing at Amazon elsewhere, such as in France, where they precipitated a month-long closure of its warehouses last year.\\n\\nAs of Jan. 7, Amazon employed almost 6,200 hourly workers at the warehouse, according to the filing. To win, the union needs a simple majority of those who submit ballots.\\n\\nWhile Amazon had preferred in-person voting, the labor board sided with the union on a mail-in procedure “because this is the safest and most appropriate method of conducting an election in view of the extraordinary circumstances presented by the COVID-19 pandemic,” the filing said.\\n\\nAmerica\\'s second-largest private employer after Walmart Inc, Amazon has long avoided unionization, and it has trained managers to spot organizing activity. A website, doitwithoutdues.com www.doitwithoutdues.com, warns the Bessemer employees, \"why pay almost $500 in dues? We’ve got you covered* with high wages, health care, vision, and dental benefits.\"\\n\\nIn statements, Amazon said the website’s purpose was to educate staff about “the facts of joining a union” and that “We will continue to insist on measures for a fair election.” The company added that its rejected proposal for an in-person election would improve “associate convenience, vote fidelity, and timeliness of vote count.”\\n\\nThe RWDSU declined to comment.\\n\\nThe world’s largest online retailer has faced criticism over its handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, prompting some workers to protest outside warehouses and demand their closure. Labor organizing has begun in different parts of the company.\\n\\nAmazon, reporting more than 19,000 COVID-19 cases as of September, has said it increased cleaning, rolled out virus tests and temperature checks, and added other measures to protect associates.\\n\\nBallots will be mailed on Feb. 8, the board filing said.',\n",

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\\n\\nAmazon took its case to the Luxembourg-based General Court, Europe’s second-highest, on Tuesday, asking it to annul the EU’s decision to exclude Italy from the wider investigation, a court filing shows.\\n\\nThe move came two months after the European Commission opened an investigation into the criteria the company uses to select winners of its “buy box”, which allows customers to add items from a specific retailer directly into their shopping carts.\\n\\nThe probe will also examine whether the company gives preferential treatment to its own retail offers and marketplace sellers that use its logistics and delivery services.\\n\\nThe Italian case was launched in 2019 over the same issue but focuses on the Italian logistics markets.\\n\\nAmazon said the EU should absorb the Italian case for the sake of consistency and efficiency.\\n\\n“When the European Commission decides to investigate a matter, European law says that national competition authorities cannot investigate the same topic. This did not occur in this instance, as the Commission’s opening decision attempts to exclude Italy,” Amazon said in a statement.\\n\\nThe Commission said it would defend its case in court.\\n\\nLast November it charged Amazon with damaging retail competition by using its size, power and data to gain an unfair advantage over smaller merchants that sell on its online platform.\\n\\nThe case is T19/21.',\n",

       " {'news': \"WASHINGTON, Jan 21 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - The president’s poet woke up a superstar on Thursday, after a powerful reading at the U.S. inauguration catapulted 22-year-old Amanda Gorman to the top of Amazon’s best-seller list.\\n\\nHours after Gorman’s electric performance at the swearing-in of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, her two books - neither out yet - topped Amazon.com’s sales list.\\n\\n“I AM ON THE FLOOR MY BOOKS ARE #1 & #2 ON AMAZON AFTER 1 DAY!” Gorman, a Los Angeles resident, wrote on Twitter.\\n\\nGorman’s debut poetry collection ‘The Hill We Climb’ won top spot in the online retail giant’s sale charts, closely followed by her upcoming ‘Change Sings: A Children’s Anthem’.\\n\\nWhile poetry’s popularity is on the up, it remains a niche market and the overnight adulation clearly caught Gorman short.\\n\\n“Thank you so much to everyone for supporting me and my words. As Yeats put it: ‘For words alone are certain good: Sing, then’.”\\n\\nGorman, the youngest poet in U.S. history to mark the transition of presidential power, offered a hopeful vision for a deeply divided country in Wednesday’s rendition.\\n\\n“Being American is more than a pride we inherit. It’s the past we step into and how we repair it,” Gorman said on the steps of the U.S. Capitol two weeks after a mob laid siege and following a year of global protests for racial justice.\\n\\n“We will not march back to what was. We move to what shall be, a country that is bruised, but whole. Benevolent, but bold. Fierce and free.”\\n\\nThe performance stirred instant acclaim, with praise from across the country and political spectrum, from the Republican-backing Lincoln Project to former President Barack Obama.\\n\\n“Wasn’t @TheAmandaGorman’s poem just stunning? She’s promised to run for president in 2036 and I for one can’t wait,” tweeted former presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.\\n\\nA graduate of Harvard University, Gorman says she overcame a speech impediment in her youth and became the first U.S. National Youth Poet Laureate in 2017.\\n\\nShe has now joined the ranks of august inaugural poets such as Robert Frost and Maya Angelou.\\n\\nHer social media reach boomed, with her tens of thousands of followers ballooning into a Twitter fan base of a million-plus.\\n\\n“I have never been prouder to see another young woman rise! Brava Brava, @TheAmandaGorman! Maya Angelou is cheering—and so am I,” tweeted TV host Oprah Winfrey.\\n\\nGorman’s books are both due out in September.\\n\\nThird on Amazon's best selling list was another picture book linked to politics and projecting hope: 'Ambitious Girl' by Vice-President Kamala Harris' niece, Meena Harris.

       " {'news': '(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday rejected Parler’s demand that Amazon.com Inc restore web hosting services for the social media platform, which Amazon had cut off following the Jan. 6 storming of the U.S. Capitol.\\n\\nU.S. District Judge Barbara Rothstein in Seattle said Parler was unlikely to prove Amazon breached its contract or violated antitrust law by suspending service on Jan. 10, and that it was “not a close call.”\\n\\nShe also forcefully rejected the suggestion that the public interest would be served by a preliminary injunction requiring Amazon Web Services to “host the kind of abusive, violent content at issue in this case, particularly in light of the recent riots at the U.S. Capitol.”\\n\\n“That event,” she added, “was a tragic reminder that inflammatory rhetoric can - more swiftly and easily than many of us would have hoped - turn a lawful protest into a violent insurrection.”\\n\\nParler was not immediately available for comment.\\n\\n“We welcome the court’s careful ruling,” an Amazon spokeswoman said in a statement. “This was not a case about free speech. It was about a customer that consistently violated our terms of service.”\\n\\nAmazon said Parler ignored repeated warnings to effectively moderate the growth on its website of violent content, which included calls to assassinate prominent Democratic politicians, leading business executives and members of the media.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: A screengrab of Parler.com website and Parler CEO John Matze\\'s message on January 16, 2021, reading \"Hello world, is this thing on?\", seen in this picture obtained on January 17, 2021 from social media. PARLER.COM WEBSITE /via REUTERS\\n\\nResearchers have said far-right groups at the Capitol had a vigorous online presence on platforms including Parler, where they spread violent rhetoric.\\n\\nParler said there was no evidence apart from anecdotes in the press that it had a role in inciting the riots, and that it was unfair to deprive millions of law-abiding Americans a platform for free speech.\\n\\nIt also said Amazon had no right to threaten its “extinction” by pulling the plug, and had been motivated by “political animus” to benefit Twitter Inc, a larger Amazon client that Parler said did not censor violent content targeting conservatives.\\n\\nRothstein rejected that argument, saying Parler had merely raised the “specter of preferential treatment” for Twitter.\\n\\nMany supporters of former U.S. President Donald Trump favor Parler, which has claimed it had more than 12 million users.\\n\\nParler remains largely offline after being dropped by Seattle-based Amazon and the app stores of Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google following the Washington unrest.\\n\\nThose companies also cited Parler’s record of policing violent content.\\n\\nParler Chief Executive Officer John Matze told Reuters on Jan. 13 that Parler may be offline for good, but later pledged it would return stronger.\\n\\nMatze and his family were forced to “go into hiding” after receiving death threats, his lawyer said on Jan. 15.\\n\\nA static version of Parler’s website recently returned, including a notice saying Parler was having technical difficulties, and a handful of posts from people like Fox News hosts Sean Hannity and Mark Levin.\\n\\nChief Operating Officer Jeffrey Wernick said on Tuesday that Parler was posting comments on behalf of “friends who reached out.”\\n\\nThe site’s internet protocol address is owned by DDos-Guard, which is controlled by two Russian men and provides protection from distributed denial-of-service attacks, according to infrastructure expert Ronald Guilmette.',\n",

       " {'news': 'CHERBOURG, France/DUBLIN (Reuters) - From his office overlooking Cherbourg docks, general manager Yannick Millet points to trailers destined for Ireland that belong to Amazon and FedEx, new customers and a signal of a potential big shift in post-Brexit trade.\\n\\nConfronted by red tape and delays after Britain’s messy exit from the European Union, Irish traders are shipping goods directly to and from European ports, shunning the once-speedier route through Britain.\\n\\n“You see the shift in supply chains right here,” he said.\\n\\nAll five operators connecting Ireland to mainland Europe have increased ferry services in the past nine months, with some bringing forward planned sailings and others moving larger ships away from quieter British routes to meet new demand.\\n\\nMillet forecast Cherbourg would handle 9,000 trucks in January, equivalent to almost a quarter of what passed through the French port annually before the COVID-19 crisis.\\n\\nFor decades, the land bridge offered Irish traders the swiftest, most reliable route to continental Europe. It involves a short sea crossing between Dublin and Holyhead in Wales and then a hop between Dover and Calais. Every year 150,000 lorries would use the route.\\n\\nBut post-Brexit paperwork and delays in customs clearance are snarling up the process, adding hours or days to journeys and ratcheting up costs. Many companies are switching routes.\\n\\n“This is a game-changer,” said Chris Smyth, commercial director at Ireland’s Perennial Freight. Demand was huge for freight space to ship to Cherbourg, Dunkirk, Rotterdam and Zeebrugge, he added.\\n\\nCherbourg’s business before Brexit had been evenly split between Ireland and Britain. Now, the port would orient itself towards Ireland, Millet said.\\n\\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\\n\\n“I thought traffic would double but it has tripled,” he said. “The question now is whether the traffic volumes we see today will hold in the months to come.”\\n\\nAVOIDING THE MIDDLEMAN\\n\\nStena Line, the largest Irish Sea operator, has doubled its services on the booming Rosslare-Cherbourg route, temporarily cancelling some sailings to Britain after freight volumes fell 60% in the first half of January.\\n\\nIrish Ferries has deployed a larger vessel out of Dublin and planned to add more weekly rotations next month, the Port of Cherbourg said. Brittany Ferries also brought forward a planned sailing linking France and Ireland.\\n\\nDanish operator DFDS said the freight ferries plying its new 23-hour crossing from Rosslare to Dunkirk six days a week were “pretty much full”. Route director Aidan Coffey said capturing 30% of “land bridge” traffic would make the route viable and DFDS might soon add up to two more sailings per week.\\n\\n“We’re blown away by the demand,” Coffey said.\\n\\nNo one knows if the shift is permanent.\\n\\nThe Irish Maritime Development Office, a government shipping promotion body, said a return to pre-Brexit logistic chains would depend on the speed of customs formalities along the land bridge and that ferries linking Ireland and mainland Europe could not replicate its volumes.\\n\\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\\n\\nEddie Burke, a senior official at Ireland’s transport department, said the route through Britain would undoubtedly come back into play again.\\n\\nFerry operators were taking decisions on capacity week by week, said Ole Bockmann, Stena’s operations chief in Cherbourg.

Its traffic volumes were stagnant while rivals were enjoying a 10-year run of growth.\\n\\nNow its general manager, Glenn Carr, is fending off complaints about the number trucks passing through after freight traffic increased 500% in the first half of January.\\n\\nCarr said the old perception that direct crossings from Ireland were too long for fresh food and just-in-time supply chains was changing. Many of the companies that had switched from the land bridge would remain, he forecast.\\n\\n“I was talking to some multinationals only this week and the question they asked me was, ‘Glenn, are you putting on more services?’”\\n\\nAn 18-hour ferry ride away, Cherbourg port’s Millet said his immediate priority was responding to shipping companies demands for better restaurants and washrooms for truckers and ironing out quayside glitches in the loading of extra vessels.\\n\\n“Brexit has for us been an opportunity to rethink our port,” he said.',\n",

       " {'news': \"MUMBAI (Reuters Breakingviews) - Jeff Bezos has the patience and gritty determination it takes do business in India. The Amazon boss is locked in an ugly fight to stop a troubled big-box retailer from selling itself to his biggest rival, Mukesh Ambani’s $166 billion Reliance Industries. Any victory by the U.S. e-commerce giant could wind up costing thousands of jobs and spark a nasty political backlash, but the standoff also might deliver longer-term rewards.\\n\\nFILE PHOTO: Kishore Biyani, CEO and founder of India's Future Group poses after the inauguration of Foodhall, a premium lifestyle food superstore by the Future Group, store in Mumbai, India, December 1, 2018. REUTERS/Francis Mascarenhas/File Photo\\n\\nAmbani will turbocharge his retail business if he successfully acquires Kishore Biyani’s sprawling Future empire. The $3.4 billion deal announced in August includes more than 17 companies. In addition to its huge oil and telecom operations, Reliance is India’s top brick-and-mortar retailer, with some 12,000 stores. Swallowing Future Retail, its closest competitor, would bag another 1,500. India’s Competition Commission already has cleared the deal.\\n\\nThe takeover would trample over part of Amazon’s expansion strategy in online groceries. It has a partnership with Future Retail, including its Big Bazaar hypermarkets. The $1.6 trillion company snapped up upscale U.S. supermarket chain Whole Foods back in 2017 in its biggest acquisition. In India, however, where Amazon already has invested some $6.5 billion over the past decade, it lacks its own physical shops. Even Walmart’s Indian online marketplace, Flipkart, has the benefit of the Best Price cash-and-carry stores operated by its parent company.\\n\\nIn its push to stop the sale to Reliance, Amazon has been accused of acting like the East India Company, a 17th century London start-up whose employees killed, pillaged and bribed as they conquered the subcontinent. Counsel for Biyani’s Future group have trotted out the provocative comparison to complain that a foreign company is using a dubious minority investment to decide the fate of a struggling Indian outfit.\\n\\nCOUPON CLIPPING\\n\\nAmazon’s involvement is contentious. Bezos took a circuitous route to sink his claws into Future Retail after debt issues prompted Biyani to consider selling. India does not welcome foreign direct investment into physical retailers that sell multiple brands. Indian politicians consider mom-and-pop store owners as an important constituency. But Prime Minister Narendra Modi is easing investment restrictions across multiple sectors and Bezos reasonably took a punt that rules governing retail might change too.\\n\\nOn that basis, Amazon spent about $200 million in August 2019 to pick up a 49% stake in Future Coupons, a wholesaling part of the group. As part of the deal, Biyani and his related entities agreed to restrictions on transferring shares. According to Amazon, that included to Reliance. At the time, Biyani’s group, along with Future Coupons, controlled Future Retail through stock and warrants. Days earlier, Future Coupons inked a separate agreement giving it the right to veto any transfer of assets by Future Retail, effectively locking up the shopping assets.\\n\\nAlmost exactly a year later, as Biyani’s debt problems ballooned, Amazon was shoved aside. Reliance swooped in and agreed to its own complex, multistage deal to buy Future’s retail, wholesale and supply chain businesses. If that transaction closes, Amazon and other investors in Future companies will end up owning shares in a rump that holds a hodgepodge of assets including an insurance joint venture with Generali.\\n\\nIndia’s foreign investment rules mean Amazon is precluded from offering an alternative deal to Reliance’s to stop Future Retail from going into liquidation, which could save some 29,000 jobs. Amazon had lined up friendly domestic backers to try and help before the Reliance deal was struck. They were interested in the retail operations, but not much of the rest. Either way, any such investors are unlikely to be interested in going up against India’s richest man.\\n\\nBezos is not intimidated, however. He’s fighting to uphold Amazon’s original agreement, in part to make clear that he won’t be pushed around. The company in October won an emergency hold on the transaction through an arbitration in Singapore, and lawyers for both sides are now arguing in a Delhi court about whether that ruling applies in India. The outcome is key to Future group’s fate and the dispute could go all the way to the country’s top court.\\n\\nPRECEDENTS SET\\n\\nAmazon is testing the enforceability of contracts in the world’s fifth largest economy, a measure of the ease of doing business. It’s also a fresh test to see if local courts uphold foreign arbitration awards; overseas companies with Indian partners typically look to London or Singapore tribunals. Japanese telecom operator NTT Docomo and pharmaceutical company Daiichi Sankyo both won overseas arbitrations against commercial partners and those rulings were upheld in India.\\n\\nPoliticians reeling from the pandemic won’t be pleased if Amazon’s aggressive move results in job losses. A local media report last week suggested an official investigative agency is probing the company’s Future deal for potential violations of foreign investment rules. But India is better off with Amazon than without it. The company operates 60 massive fulfilment centres and is creating jobs, developing logistics and supporting exports by small- and medium-sized Indian businesses.\\n\\nThe entire mess might have been avoided had India set a stronger example for tycoons to follow. Even now it is unclear if the government will honour two recent arbitration rulings it lost over tax disputes with British companies. Cairn Energy has written to New Delhi threatening to seize Indian assets overseas if it fails to pay the $1.4 billion awarded in its favour. Unlike Vodafone, which also won its case, the oil and gas explorer can afford to play hardball because it is no longer invested in the country.\\n\\nFuture’s retail assets are a prize, but not necessarily a must-have in a fragmented retail market. The bigger message is Amazon’s willingness to fight against powerful rivals. To win in India, that is what it will take.\",\n",

It has said it could face liquidation if the deal falls through.\\n\\nU.S. online giant Amazon, which had its sights set on ultimately owning part of the retail assets itself, argued a 2019 deal it had with a unit of Future contained clauses prohibiting the Indian group from selling them to anyone on a “restricted persons” list including Reliance.\\n\\nThe corporate battle has embroiled sprawling businesses led by two of the world’s richest men - Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Reliance’s Mukesh Ambani.\\n\\nIt could help determine whether Amazon will be able to eat away at the dominance of Reliance, which sells through its network of more than 12,000 stores, at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has seen shoppers race online.\\n\\nAfter Future said it was not bound by an arbitrator’s order that put the deal on hold, Amazon last month urged the High Court in New Delhi to enforce it.\\n\\nJustice J. R. Midha said on Tuesday that an immediate order was necessary to protect the U.S. company’s rights, adding that the arbitrator had “rightly proceeded” against Future.\\n\\n“This court is of the clear view that the (arbitration) order ... is enforceable,” Midha added. “All the concerned authorities are directed to maintain status quo.”\\n\\nAmazon said it welcomed the order. Future said it would explore all legal remedies to pursue the deal.\\n\\nReliance did not respond to requests for comment.\\n\\nLEGAL BRAINS\\n\\nFuture’s planned deal to sell its retail, wholesale, logistics and certain other businesses to Reliance for $3.38 billion, including debt, had already been cleared by Indian stock exchanges and the antitrust watchdog, though it was awaiting approval from a law tribunal.\\n\\nJustice Midha directed a federal government counsel to relay the court’s decision to all authorities who were involved in reviewing the Future-Reliance deal. Future had acted “in violation” of the arbitrator’s order, he added.\\n\\nBoth Future and Amazon hired some of the country’s best legal brains to argue the matter, with the U.S. company engaging law firms P&A Law Offices and AZB & Partners.\\n\\nFuture, in sometimes acrimonious court arguments, accused Amazon of blocking its deal in an attempt to thwart any competition from Reliance, which has plans to expand into e-commerce.\\n\\nAmazon said at some point it wanted to become a single largest shareholder of Future Retail, which it says “has an irreplaceable and widespread network” of outlets across India.',\n",

He had been a clear contender for the top job since Amazon created two CEO roles reporting to Bezos years ago, the other held by recently retired consumer CEO Jeff Wilke.\\n\\nTom Johnson, chief transformation officer at global marketing firm Mindshare, said Jassy’s promotion underscored the centrality of the web hosting business to Amazon’s strategy.\\n\\n“Jassy’s background in steering AWS shows just how top of mind those services are to Amazon’s business strategy. It’ll be interesting to see how that affects their strategy and balancing that priority with a growing ad business and the commerce behemoth,” he said.\\n\\nJassy is known for understanding highly technical details and has regularly taken jabs at legacy player Oracle Corp and cloud rival Microsoft Corp, which AWS continues to exceed in sales. Bezos has made fewer public remarks about competitors.\\n\\nUnder Jassy’s leadership, Amazon’s cloud business has signed major customers including Verizon, McDonald’s and Honeywell. Silicon Valley startups have long relied on AWS, and the division’s annual revenue grew 37% in 2019 and 30% in 2020, helping cement its position as the market leader.\\n\\nOne contract AWS failed to win was the $10 billion “JEDI” project from the Pentagon, which was awarded to Microsoft.\\n\\nJassy has aimed to bestow a rock-star aura to keynotes at AWS’s annual Las Vegas conference, speaking before over 60,000 attendees in 2019 after upbeat music preceded his talk.\\n\\nBezos, who already has focused on other personal enterprises in years past, said in a note to employees posted on Amazon’s website, “As Exec Chair I will stay engaged in important Amazon initiatives but also have the time and energy I need to focus on the Day 1 Fund, the Bezos Earth Fund, Blue Origin, The Washington Post, and my other passions.” Blue Origin is Bezos’ space company.\\n\\nHe added, “I’ve never had more energy, and this isn’t about retiring.”\\n\\nChief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said on a call with analysts that Bezos would work on “large one-way door issues,” such as acquisitions and other strategies where there is a high cost to reversing course.\\n\\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\\n\\nCOVID SPENDING DOWN\\n\\nAmazon’s net sales rose to $125.6 billion as consumers turned to the world’s largest online retailer for their holiday shopping, beating analyst estimates of $119.7 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.\\n\\nAmazon shares were up less than 1% in after-hours trading.\\n\\nSlideshow ( 5 images )\\n\\nJassy’s AWS, traditionally a bright spot, fell slightly short of expectations in the fourth quarter. While the cloud computing division recently announced deals with ViacomCBS, the BMW Group and others, it posted revenue of $12.7 billion, short of the $12.8 billion analysts had estimated.\\n\\nAmazon said it was not naming an AWS replacement for Jassy at this time.\\n\\nMeanwhile Amazon’s e-commerce business has never been as big. Since the start of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, consumers have turned to Amazon for delivery of home staples and medical supplies. While brick-and-mortar shops closed their doors, Amazon recruited over 400,000 more workers to keep up with demand.\\n\\nThat has placed the Seattle-based company at the center of workplace tumult. More than 19,000 have contracted COVID-19 as of September, and some staff have protested and demanded facility closures. Others, at Amazon’s Bessemer, Alabama, warehouse, are seeking to be the first at the company to unionize in the United States, with an election to begin next week.\\n\\nOlsavsky told reporters on a conference call that costs associated with the pandemic in the first quarter are expected to total $2 billion, down from $4 billion in the fourth quarter as shopping volumes decrease. The company has taken an array of COVID-19 precautions and written government officials - including U.S. President Joe Biden - saying it is eager to offer vaccine shots to staff.\\n\\nA boost in revenue came from moving Amazon’s marketing event Prime Day - usually in July - to October, lengthening the holiday shopping season.\\n\\nNet sales for the current quarter are expected to be between $100 billion and $106 billion.',\n",

It was super important to the Amazon people that we come that Monday.”\\n\\n** Jassy is married to Elana Rochelle Caplan and is the father of two children. He is also a self-proclaimed sports and music fan.\\n\\n** In 2006, Jassy founded Amazon’s AWS, Amazon’s cloud service platform used by millions of businesses across the world. The service competes with Microsoft Corp’s Azure and Alphabet Inc’s Google Cloud.\\n\\n** Jassy has occasionally spoken out on social issues, tweeting about the need for police accountability after Breonna Taylor, a Black woman, was slain in her home by white policemen during a botched raid, and in favor of LGBTQ rights.\\n\\n** Amazon on Tuesday reported its third consecutive record profit and quarterly sales above $100 billion for the first time and also announced that Jassy will replace Bezos.',\n",

       " {'news': \"Founder, Chairman, CEO and President of Amazon Jeff Bezos speaks during an event about Blue Origin's space exploration plans in Washington, U.S., May 9, 2019. REUTERS/Clodagh Kilcoyne\\n\\nNEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Jeff Bezos has some solid timing. The founder and chief executive of Amazon.com is handing over the CEO role to Andy Jassy, head of the cloud division AWS, after a fortuitously good year at the $1.7 trillion retail giant. The new boss will face a different, more challenging normal that includes regulatory scrutiny.\\n\\nFirst the results: Amazon said Tuesday that fourth-quarter revenue rose 44% year-over-year to $126 billion. That’s the first time the company topped $100 billion of sales in a quarter helped by delivering items to customer’s doorsteps during the pandemic and, of course, the holidays.\\n\\nThat’s the good news. The rest harkens some major challenges for Jassy. Operating expenses ballooned 42% in part because costs associated with worldwide shipping rose about two-thirds. The vaccine rollout will coincide with choice, which could make life harder for Amazon. The company is forecasting sales volume to drop by a quarter in this period compared to three months ending December.\\n\\nThe hurdles may partly be why Jassy is now leading the company. AWS is one of Amazon’s jewels. Growth slowed a tad in the fourth quarter to 28%, but the division has much higher margins than Amazon’s other units, booking more than half of its operating profit despite accounting for just 12% of total sales.\\n\\nAnd yet Amazon’s success is precisely what will make Washington continue its pursuit of the retail giant. On the same day as earnings, Amazon agreed to pay more than $60 million to the Federal Trade Commission to settle charges it withheld some tips from drivers.\\n\\nTime away from the corner office will give Bezos the opportunity to focus on his other projects including the Bezos Earth Fund and the Washington Post. He will likely continue to have a guiding hand, too, and perhaps will find himself in the Beltway hot seat. Still, the company’s forward enterprise value-to-sales figure is hovering near its high, hit earlier this year. As Bezos steps aside, Amazon is staring at the end of living high on the hog.\",\n",

       " {'news': '(Reuters) -Amazon.com’s new chief executive, Andy Jassy, who joined the company in 1997 and has overseen its fast-growing cloud computing business, says the key to long-term success is reinvention.\\n\\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\\n\\n“You want to be reinventing when you are healthy, you want to be reinventing all the time,” Jassy, 53, said in December at a company forum. “You have got to be manancial and relentless and tenacious about getting to the truth.... You have to know what’s working and what’s not working.”\\n\\nHe cited Netflix’s decision to cannibalize its own DVD rental business in favor of streaming.\\n\\nThe focus on the future is fitting given Jassy’s career is defined by his leading Amazon into a wholly new market: cloud computing. Amazon Web Services rents space and software programming for customers to run their technical operations on the company’s servers. The arm now fuels Amazon’s profits and dominates the cloud market just as the company leads the world of e-commerce.\\n\\nJassy, who joined Amazon after graduating from Harvard Business School, worked as a technical assistant for Bezos in the early 2000s and was instrumental in leading the company’s push outside of book sales.\\n\\nJassy’s rise to the top job looked clear after longtime executive and consumer chief Jeff Wilke announced his retirement after more than two decades with the company. Wilke was Amazon’s second most high-ranking official along with Jassy.\\n\\nHis attitude of embracing change also made him a favorite.\\n\\nAt the same speech in December, Jassy noted just 83 of the Fortune 500 companies from 1970 are still on the list -- and only half are on the list from 2000.\\n\\n“It’s really hard to build a business that sustains for a long period of time,” Jassy said, adding, to stay on the list, he said, “you are going to have to reinvent yourself” and often more than once.\\n\\nHe said the pandemic has boosted the shift to the cloud.\\n\\n“When you look back on the history of the cloud it will turn out the pandemic accelerated cloud adoption by several years,” Jassy said.\\n\\nOne of his big challenges has been navigating the loss of a $10 billion Pentagon cloud contract to Microsoft and Jassy did not mince words when going after former President Donald Trump for unfairly influencing the process.\\n\\nOutside of Amazon, Jassy is an avid sports fan. Jassy is part-owner of the new Seattle National Hockey League franchise, the Kraken, which will join the league in the 2021-2022 season.',\n",

REUTERS/Mike Segar\\n\\nA court in New Delhi blocked Future Group’s sale of retail assets to Reliance Industries on Tuesday after Amazon raised objections to the deal.\\n\\nThe corporate battle has embroiled sprawling businesses led by two of the world’s richest men: Amazon’s Jeff Bezos and Reliance’s Mukesh Ambani.\\n\\nAmazon had argued that Future breached contracts by selling retail assets to Reliance. The court sided with the U.S. firm, saying an earlier order from an arbitrator that put the Future-Reliance deal on hold was valid.\\n\\nFuture - which had argued the arbitrator’s order was not binding - on Wednesday filed a challenge against the court’s ruling, saying the company’s creditors would be at “significant risk” if the Reliance deal fails.\\n\\nOther than an estimated 300 billion rupees ($4.1 billion) hit to bank loans and debentures, the deal’s failure would also impact livelihoods of 50,000 employees and 6,000 small- and medium-sized vendors, it said.\\n\\n“It is inevitable that FRL (Future Retail) will go into liquidation ... The magnitude of damage that may be caused to the public at large is unimaginable,” Future said the court filing, seen by Reuters.\\n\\nThe appeal is set to be heard on Thursday before a bigger two-judge bench in New Delhi.\\n\\nFuture, India’s second-largest retailer with more than 1,700 stores, and Amazon did not respond to a request for comment.\\n\\nShares of Future Retail dropped 5% in early trading on Wednesday. Reliance Industries fell as much as 1.2%, but recovered later.\\n\\nThe Delhi court on Tuesday asked Indian authorities to maintain status quo on the transaction, effectively putting the Future-Reliance deal on hold.\\n\\nIndian stock exchanges and the country’s antitrust watchdog had already cleared the deal, though it was awaiting approval from a law tribunal.\\n\\nFuture in its appeal said Tuesday’s Delhi court order “rendered stillborn” the approvals.\\n\\n“The sole and sheer intent” of Amazon was to prevent Reliance - which is also venturing into e-commerce - from acquiring Future’s assets, the Indian firm argued in the filing.\\n\\nAmazon, which had its sights set on ultimately owning part of Future’s retail assets itself, has argued a 2019 deal it had with a unit of Future contained clauses prohibiting the Indian group from selling them to anyone on a “restricted persons” list, including Reliance.',\n",

REUTERS/Joshua Roberts/File Photo\\n\\nBezos, whose email address is public, receives customer complaints that he then forwards to a relevant executive whose team is responsible for fixing the problem. Sometimes landing overnight, these emails from the world’s second-richest person had no salutation, no commentary or thank you - just a single question mark.\\n\\nOr worse, said one former manager.\\n\\n“‘This can’t be true’ was a bad one. ‘Fix this’ was another,” the manager said on condition of anonymity. “By the morning, I better have a damn good resolution to whatever this is.”\\n\\nAmazon said Bezos sent question-mark emails occasionally to manage the volume of customer messages he received.\\n\\nIt was an effective tool: efficient for Bezos - who juggled oversight of retail, technology, media and space businesses - and motivating for employees who feared for their jobs, the former manager said.\\n\\nBezos will step back from the company he founded 27 years ago and become executive chairman this summer, Amazon said Tuesday.\\n\\nSome recall the practice with nostalgia. Sean Scott, a vice president of autonomous delivery who recently left Amazon after nearly 15 years, said working with Bezos was rewarding but stressful.\\n\\n“Meetings with Jeff were always an unbelievable amount of work in prep during the lead up (as were the ? emails) but the dialog and the Q&A during the meeting would remain with the team forever,” he said in a LinkedIn post Tuesday.\\n\\nNo one can predict how incoming CEO Andy Jassy will govern in his boss’ shoes. The cloud computing head cares just as much about fixing customers’ problems.\\n\\nBut three executives who worked with him said the single question mark is not his style.\",\n",

       " {'news': 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House and the labor leaders connected with the Retail, Wholesale & Department Store Union have discussed the group’s effort to unionize an Amazon.com Inc facility in Alabama, an RWDSU official said on Wednesday.\\n\\nAmazon, America’s second-biggest private employer behind Walmart Inc, does not have any union labor in the United States, and workers at its fulfillment center in Bessemer, Alabama, would be the first to join if they vote in favour.\\n\\nThe last attempt by Amazon workers to unionize was in 2014.\\n\\nA White House spokeswoman, who declined to comment directly on the Alabama effort, said President Biden supports union organizing and collective bargaining and has urged employers not to run anti-union campaigns or interfere with organizing and bargaining. He has also called for holding employers accountable and increasing penalties when they do, she added.\\n\\nRWDSU President Stuart Appelbaum told Reuters the conversation with a top advisor to President Joe Biden took place after the inauguration and focused on their efforts to organize the facility in Alabama.\\n\\n“We wanted to inform the White House that this campaign was taking place and that they would be hearing about it... we did not make any specific request,” Appelbaum said, adding that the Biden advisor was interested in learning more about the situation in Alabama.\\n\\nAppelbaum said labor leaders “connected to the RWDSU” spoke to the White House, but he declined to name who they spoke with. He also said another senior advisor to Biden has been tracking the Alabama effort.\\n\\n“The larger labor movement has indicated to the White House that this is an important campaign, that this is a priority,” Appelbaum said.\\n\\nOn Feb. 8, the National Labor Relations Board will mail ballots to 5,805 workers at the facility near Birmingham, who will then have seven weeks to decide whether they want the RWDSU to represent them.\\n\\nThe effort to secure White House support by labor leaders underscores the high stakes involved, as Amazon fights its biggest labor battle yet in the United States. A victory for the union could encourage workers attempting to organize at other Amazon facilities.\\n\\nAmazon spokeswoman Rachael Lighty said the company does not “believe the RWDSU represents the majority of our employees’ views.” The company’s employees choose to work at Amazon because “we offer some of the best jobs available everywhere we hire, and we encourage anyone to compare our total compensation package, health benefits, and workplace environment to any other company with similar jobs,” she added.\\n\\nAmazon has long avoided unionization, and it has trained managers to spot organizing activity. A website advocating Amazon workers shun unions, doitwithoutdues.com, warned the Bessemer employees, “why pay almost $500 in dues? We’ve got you covered* with high wages, health care, vision, and dental benefits.”\\n\\nThe COVID pandemic spurred labor organizing in different parts of the company and the world’s largest online retailer has faced a barrage of criticism over its handling of a coronavirus outbreak at its warehouses and other facilities.\\n\\nAmazon, reporting more than 19,000 COVID-19 cases as of September, has said it increased cleaning, implemented virus tests and temperature checks, and added other measures to protect associates.',\n",

       " {'news': '(Fixes typo in bullet point)\\n\\n* Amazon is rolling out AI-enabled surveillance cameras in its delivery vans\\n\\n* Drivers and privacy advocates say the company is building a massive mobile surveillance system\\n\\n* Although the system is billed to improve driver safety, some worry it is more about exerting control\\n\\nBy Avi Asher-Schapiro\\n\\nBERLIN, Feb 5 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Amazon.com Inc’s announcement this week that it would be rolling out AI-powered cameras in its branded delivery vans for safety has drawn criticism from privacy advocates and workers concerned with being subjected to surveillance on the job.\\n\\nThe world’s largest e-commerce firm said the cameras, which are developed by transportation technology company Netradyne, would improve safety of both drivers and the communities in which they deliver.\\n\\nBut employees like Henry Search, a 22-year-old delivery driver in Washington state, said they saw cameras capturing their work day as an “invasion of privacy”.\\n\\n“We are out here working all day, trying our best already,” Search told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in a phone interview. “The cameras are just another way to control us.”\\n\\nPrivacy advocates warned that equipping Amazon’s fleet of about 30,000 delivery vehicles with AI cameras could set a dangerous precedent for privacy.\\n\\n“This appears to be the largest expansion of corporate surveillance in human history,” said Evan Greer, deputy director of tech nonprofit Fight for the Future. “If this becomes the norm, we are talking about the extinction of human privacy.”\\n\\nAmazon has come under scrutiny in the past for accidents involving delivery drivers.\\n\\nA company spokeswoman said in emailed comments that “this technology will provide drivers real-time alerts to help them stay safe when they are on the road.”\\n\\nIn an instructional video about the cameras, Amazon’s senior manager for last-mile safety Karolina Haraldsdottir said cameras will record 100% of the time, but are not set up to livestream from inside of vans.\\n\\nThey will detect unsafe driving, including when drivers appear distracted or drowsy, she explained, adding that the footage could be used by the company’s safety team, or in investigations of theft or accidents.\\n\\nBut Greer said that safety issues could be addressed by slowing the pace of work. “The first thing they (Amazon) should do to improve safety would be not have such outrageous delivery quotas that force people into unsafe conditions,” she said.\\n\\nAnother driver in Massachusetts, who asked not to use his name to protect his identity, said he would welcome a camera displayed outside his van to record evidence for any accident.\\n\\n“But a camera on my face all the time, I don’t see how that keeps me safe - it’s too much,” he said in a phone interview, noting that drivers already use an app called Mentor that tracks the location and movements of the vehicle.\\n\\nDATA USE\\n\\nHaraldsdottir said that “only a limited set of authorized people” would have access to driver footage from the cameras.\\n\\nBut some drivers worried Amazon might sell or share the footage with third parties, or use the cameras to monitor their performance on the job.\\n\\n“The footage recorded could be shared with a future possible employer who can then decide to reject you before even knowing you,” said one driver from Michigan who asked not to give his full name.\\n\\nAlthough he enjoys doing deliveries for Amazon, he said he is currently looking for other work because he does not want to be subjected to surveillance.\\n\\nRights activists say Amazon already has an extensive surveillance system in its warehouses to track workers’ movements and boost productivity, including navigation software, item scanners, wristbands, thermal cameras and recorded footage.\\n\\n“There are no laws in place to meaningfully limit what Amazon can do with the footage they collect,” said Greer, noting that other surveillance products, such as the Ring doorbell camera system, can share footage with police departments.\\n\\n‘DYSTOPIA PRIME’\\n\\nSurveillance experts say that the privacy implications of Amazon’s camera network for delivery vans extend far beyond drivers.\\n\\nAndrew Ferguson, a professor of law at D.C.’s American University, said Amazon’s private surveillance networks would further entrench the snooping powers of government.\\n\\n“While the inclination to use AI technology to enhance driver safety is commendable, the failure to think about the privacy and surveillance issues and equities is troubling,” he said.\\n\\nWhile police may not have direct access to the footage, authorities will be able to access it in the course of an investigation, expanding the reach of police surveillance, Ferguson explained.\\n\\nLast June, Amazon announced a one-year moratorium on police use of its facial recognition software, following criticism that the technology reinforced racial bias.\\n\\n“Amazon is quite literally building mobile surveillance vans to film our neighborhoods, something that we would be rightly horrified about if our government did it,” Ferguson said. “I don’t think we want to join dystopia prime.”',\n",

       " {'news': '(Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday dismissed nearly all of a lawsuit accusing upscale grocery chain Whole Foods Market of illegally punishing workers who wore Black Lives Matter face masks on the job.\\n\\nSlideshow ( 2 images )\\n\\nTwenty-seven plaintiffs had accused Whole Foods in a proposed nationwide class action filed in Boston of selectively enforcing its dress code banning “visible slogans, messages, logos or advertising” unrelated to the company.\\n\\nThe plaintiffs said Whole Foods would send workers home without pay or impose disciplinary actions for wearing the masks and related apparel, even as it let employees wear masks bearing political messages and sports team logos.\\n\\nU.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs, however, said Whole Foods and its parent, Amazon.com Inc, did not engage in racial discrimination or violate Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act of 1964.\\n\\n“At worst, they were selectively enforcing a dress code to suppress certain speech in the workplace,” she wrote. “However unappealing that might be, it is not conduct made unlawful by Title VII.”\\n\\nBurroughs said one plaintiff can pursue a retaliation claim.\\n\\nThe plaintiffs’ lawyer Shannon Liss-Riordan expects her clients to appeal, saying in an email the decision “goes against the tide of case law recognizing the critical importance of eradicating race discrimination from worksites across our country.”\\n\\nWhole Foods has said its dress code was “facially neutral” and that it has “zero tolerance” for retaliation. It has also along with Amazon expressed support for Black Lives Matter.\\n\\n“We remain dedicated to ensuring our team members feel safe and free from discrimination and retaliation,” a spokesman said following Burroughs’ decision.\\n\\nThe judge said employees who are not happy with the policy could try to persuade Whole Foods to change it, express themselves outside the workplace and perhaps encourage consumers to shop elsewhere, or find somewhere else to work.\\n\\nA video showing the death last May 25 of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police sparked nationwide protests about racial injustice, including the treatment of Blacks in police custody.\\n\\nThe case is Frith et al v Whole Foods Market Inc, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 20-11358.',\n",

       " {'news': '(Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has ordered hundreds of trucks that run on compressed natural gas as it tests ways to shift its U.S. fleet away from heavier polluting trucks, the company told Reuters on Friday.\\n\\nSlideshow ( 3 images )\\n\\nThe coronavirus pandemic caused delivery activity to surge in 2020, with truck volumes exceeding 2019 levels on average while passenger car traffic fell. But that increase in road activity means more pollution, as heavier-duty trucks emit higher levels of greenhouse gases than passenger vehicles.\\n\\nTransportation companies are building their stable of electric vehicles to reduce carbon emissions. Much of the nation’s freight is delivered via medium- and heavy-duty trucks, which account for more than 20% of the industry’s greenhouse gas emissions even though they make up less than 5% of the road fleet, according to U.S. federal data.\\n\\n“Amazon is excited about introducing new sustainable solutions for freight transportation and is working on testing a number of new vehicle types including electric, CNG and others,” the company said in a statement.\\n\\nAmazon has ordered more than 700 compressed natural gas class 6 and class 8 trucks so far, according to the company.\\n\\nThe online retailer’s sales rose 38% in 2020; it plans to run a carbon neutral business by 2040.\\n\\nThe engines, supplied by a joint venture between Cummins Inc and Vancouver-based Westport Fuel Systems Inc, are to be used for Amazon’s heavy duty trucks that run from warehouses to distribution centers. More than 1,000 engines that can operate on both renewable and non-renewable natural gas have been ordered by the supplier, according to a source familiar with the situation.\\n\\nNatural gas emits approximately 27% less carbon dioxide when burned compared with diesel fuel, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.\\n\\nElectric-powered motors are considered less viable for heavy-duty trucks than for the average passenger vehicle.\\n\\nIn 2019, Amazon ordered 100,000 electric vans from startup Rivian Automotive LLC. The first of those vans, to be used for last-mile delivery to customers, are to be delivered this year. The company also ordered 1,800 electric vans from Mercedes-Benz for its European delivery fleet.\\n\\nOther transportation companies are also experimenting with ways to reduce emissions.\\n\\nIn 2019, United Parcel Service Inc announced plans to buy more than 6,000 natural gas-powered trucks over three years and step up purchases of renewable natural gas (RNG) as part of a $450 million investment to reduce the environmental impact of its 123,000-vehicle fleet.\\n\\nRNG and natural gas from fossil fuel are both methane gases and can be used interchangeably. RNG is derived from decomposing organic matter such as cow manure on dairy farms, discarded food in landfills and human waste in water treatment plants. It also prevents naturally occurring methane - a powerful greenhouse gas - from being released into the environment.\\n\\nAmazon shares were down 0.1% in post-close trading. Shares of Cummins rose 4%, while the U.S.-listed shares of Canada-based Westport surged, gaining 47% in the aftermarket session.',\n",

       " {'news': '(Adds statement from Amazon, quote, details, background,)\\n\\nFeb 5 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc has ordered more than 1,000 truck engines that run on compressed natural gas as it tests ways to shift its U.S. fleet away from heavier polluting trucks, the company told Reuters on Friday.\\n\\nThe coronavirus pandemic has resulted in a surge in delivery activity for the likes of Amazon which saw sales soar 38% in 2020 , and similar uptick in activity for delivery vehicles that emit higher levels of pollution than passenger vehicles.\\n\\nTransportation companies are building their stable of electric vehicles to reduce carbon emissions. However, much of the nation’s freight is delivered via medium- and heavy-duty trucks, which account for more than 20% of the industry’s greenhouse gas emissions even though they make up less than 5% of the road fleet, according to U.S. federal data.\\n\\n“Amazon is excited about introducing new sustainable solutions for freight transportation and is working on testing a number of new vehicle types including electric, CNG and others,” the company said in a statement.\\n\\nElectric-powered motors are considered less viable for heavy-duty trucks than for the average passenger vehicle.\\n\\nThe engines, supplied by a joint venture between Cummins Inc and Westport Fuel Systems Inc, are to be used for Amazon’s heavy duty trucks that run from warehouses to distribution centers. They can operate on both renewable and non-renewable natural gas, according to two sources familiar with the matter.
